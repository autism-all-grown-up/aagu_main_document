<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by serving as a nexus that provides accessible information, resources, and services tailored to their unique needs. By bridging gaps in the existing infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and their supporters, facilitate information exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic individuals can access the support and opportunities they need to thrive, enhancing their well-being and independence throughout the state.</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD later in life and is raising a teenager with both diagnoses. His desire to understand these challenges led him to study the scientific and social aspects of neurodiversity. Recent changes driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers have reshaped our understanding of autism, revealing significant gaps in support for autistic adults. These changes have led to controversies and arguments that are still unfolding, emphasizing the evolving nature of the understanding of autism.</p>
<p>Through his personal journey and interactions with the local autistic community, Dr.&nbsp;Balter identified significant gaps in services, support, and understanding for autistic adults without intellectual disabilities. He was struck by the level of unmet need he heard from his peers—people with skills, education, and abilities but struggling for reasons related to autism. These personal experiences led Dr.&nbsp;Balter to found Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) to address these gaps.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>The organization has four key objectives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Facilitate connections and collaboration within the adult autistic community</li>
<li>Identify the unmet needs of autistic adults and report on the causes</li>
<li>Provide accurate, accessible, and up-to-date information and resources <em>for</em> autistic adults</li>
<li>Provide accurate, accessible, and up-to-date information and resources <em>about</em> autism and <em>about</em> the autistic community</li>

<section id="autism-all-grown-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="autism-all-grown-up">Autism All Grown Up</h2>
<p>Autism is all grown up, and it isn’t pretty. The phrase “All Grown Up” captures the bittersweet realization that often occurs when one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that their preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.</p>
<p>For decades, autism was seen as a developmental challenge that primarily affected children. Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism have cause adults to be overlooked by many people. Because so little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some existing research suggests that autistic adults face reduced life expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset of age-related cognitive concerns. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect to aging, and most of these “lost generation[s]” <span class="citation" data-cites="Wright2015">(<a href="#ref-Wright2015" role="doc-biblioref">Wright 2015</a>)</span> have not yet even been counted.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-nexus-approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-nexus-approach">The Nexus Approach</h2>
<p>Rather than working on advocacy, Dr.&nbsp;Balter feels he can more directly serve the autistic community in Oregon by solving problems on the ground. Systemic and societal problems can only be addressed through advocacy. But many of the real-world problems faced by supporting existing infrastructure by increasing the connectivity and information flow. Rather than being a hub that consumes resources and provides services, AAGU will catalyze and strengthen relationships around it to form a <em>nexus</em>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-new-world-of-autism">The New World of Autism</h2>
<p>Recent advancements in autism research, largely driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers, have highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in understanding and supporting autistic individuals. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Navigational Challenges:</strong> Most autistic individuals are not intellectually disabled but face substantial challenges navigating society. Navigating society feels like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lifelong Condition:</strong> Autism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured. There are roughly the same percentage of autistic adults as children, but there are four times as many adults as children.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neurodiversity:</strong> The neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Statistically, fewer than half of autistic people are intellectually disabled but may face challenges navigating a neurotypical world. A significant population of autistic adults has needs that are often unmet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus Gaps:</strong> Research and services have predominantly focused on children and intellectually disabled adults, leaving a gap for others. We have failed, and continue to fail, to study autistic life after high school.</p></li>

<h1>Lost Generations of Autistic Adults</h1>
<p>Autistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often face a lack of access to appropriate healthcare and support services.</p>
<p>Autistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While they rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved. Most autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn’t being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in the workplace.</p>
<p>Autistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Key issues include:</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table.</p>

<h1>Autism All Grown Up (AAGU): A Nexus for Change</h1>
<section id="origin" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="origin">Origin</h2>
<p>AAGU was born out of Dr.&nbsp;Balter’s desire to use his personal experiences and analytical skills to help his newfound community. By conducting root cause analyses and working with local organizations, he identified key areas where AAGU could make an immediate impact, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating accessible guides for obtaining adult autism diagnoses through Oregon’s Medicaid and Vocational Rehabilitation systems</li>
<li>Establishing The Uncommons, autism-friendly co-working and community spaces</li>
<li>Improving online resources for autistic adults and providing consulting services to others to do the same</li>
<li>Participating in data analysis and research efforts to better understand the needs of autistic adults in Oregon</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-we-have-started" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-we-have-started">What We Have Started</h2>
<p>AAGU has already made strides in achieving its objectives through initiatives such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partnering with Health Share Oregon to create guides for accessing autism assessments through Medicaid and developing a template Letter of Medical Necessity to facilitate evaluations through I/DD and Vocational Rehab programs</li>
<li>Securing temporary spaces for The Uncommons, autism-friendly co-working and community spaces</li>
<li>Consulting with the Autism Society of Oregon to improve their online resources</li>
<li>Participating in the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder’s data working group</li>

<p>By establishing a comprehensive support system for autistic adults, AAGU aims to improve their quality of life, promote independence, and foster a sense of community and belonging. Through a phased growth plan, AAGU will continue to expand its reach and impact, with a strong emphasis on hiring autistic individuals and providing them with meaningful employment opportunities. By leveraging the strengths and talents of the autistic community, AAGU is uniquely positioned to create lasting, positive change for autistic adults in Oregon.</p>
<hr>
<p>We have recently learned that some of these co-occurring neurodivergent traits can be diagnosed independently from autism. We have learned that many non-speaking autistic people can use language and can be brilliant writers with assistive technology. We have scientifically confirmed some anecdotes about autistic people in terms of their increased aptitude for problem-solving, pattern matching, cognitive empathy, and certain types of rational and logical thinking. Perhaps most significantly, we have learned through confirmation of the double empathy hypothesis that autistic people are not deficient in either the ability or the desire to socialize . Instead, autistic and non-autistic people have very different socialization styles, learning and sensory needs, limitations, and expectations. All of this is to say that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Autistic children inevitably grow up to be equally autistic adults and later autistic elders.</p></li>
<li><p>Any individual autistic person has a unique combination of traits that may or may not be disabling in certain contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>These same traits can be exceptionally enabling, fulfilling, and productive in other contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>The very fact of being autistic in a predominantly non-autistic world presents obstacles, inflicts subtle and overt traumas, and is extremely exhausting, even for individuals with few intrinsic obvious limitations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The obvious way to solve problems caused by a lack of correct information is to collect this information. Advocates and researchers have been pushing for this for some time, but political will and funding have been lacking. While we wait for this ongoing effort to bear fruit, AAGU can help make huge improvements simply by supporting the current infrastructure.</p>

<li>Services Cliff: Young autistic adults also face significant challenges transitioning out of high school, often referred to as the “services cliff.” This sudden drop-off in support can lead to difficulties in finding meaningful work, pursuing higher education, and living independently. [<a href="https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/" class="uri">https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>Transition to Adulthood This problem does not just affect existing adults. The sudden drop-off of support upon graduating high school has become known as the services cliff. One of the biggest worries faced by both parents of autistic people and young autistic people themselves is what will happen after they graduate from high school. Will they be offered meaningful work in tolerant and respectful environments? Will they be able to earn enough to live independently? Will they find open doors in trade schools or collegFes and be offered the support they might need?</p>
