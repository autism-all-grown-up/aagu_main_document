Because funding is limited, we use this information (called a service priority level) to decide who is eligible for services. Activities of Daily Living are the basic personal activities all of us need to do that are essential for health and safety. These activities are defined in OAR 411-015-0006 [https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-services/pages/adl.aspx](https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-services/pages/adl.aspx)\n\n\nAlexithymia\n: Alexithymia is the inability for someone to recognize, identify, and describe feelings or emotions. It is sometimes referred to as emotional blindness. [https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963](https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963)\n\n\nAsperger’s Syndrome\n: Asperger's syndrome (sometimes called high-functioning autism) is part of a wide diagnosis called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since 2013, Asperger’s syndrome is replaced by the broader diagnosis of ASD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) revised criteria. [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436-asperger-syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436-asperger-syndrome)\n\n\nCo-Occurring Conditions\n: The preferred term in the autistic community as a replacement for “comorbid” for conditions, traits, and behaviors that are commonly found along with autism.\n\n\nDouble Empathy\n: Double empathy refers to how:\n1. It is easier to understand the mindset of people who are similar to you\n2. It is more difficult to understand the mindset of those who are different from you\nThis concept was specifically developed by the autistic autism researcher Damian Milton to explain how autistics and neurotypicals empathize with each other. It explains how allistics (non-autistics) struggle to understand the lived experiences of autistics and autistics struggle to understand the lived experiences of allistics. Likewise, autistics are better at understanding other autistics and allistics are better at understanding other allistics.

However, it does not only affect these skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills. It is important to remember that there are positives to thinking differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as reasoning and in visual and creative fields. [https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia)\n\n\nDyspraxia\n: Dyspraxia is a term that refers to lifelong trouble with movement and coordination. It’s not a formal diagnosis. But you may still hear people use this term, especially in the U.K. The formal diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder (DCD). [https://www.understood.org/en/articles/understanding-dyspraxia](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/understanding-dyspraxia)\n\n\nfMRI\n: Functional MRI is a type of MRI scan that can show which areas of your brain are most active. Tracking and comparing that activity to what you were doing at the time can help “map” your brain activity. It’s most often used for planning surgery or similar procedures in the brain. [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri)\n\n\nGender identity\n: One's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth. [https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions](https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions)\n\n\nGenome\n: The genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the cell’s nucleus, as well as a small chromosome in the cell’s mitochondria. A genome contains all the information needed for an individual to develop and function.

[https://www.healthshareoregon.org/](https://www.healthshareoregon.org/)\n\n\nI/DD\n: Oregon Department of Human Services: Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\nLetter of Medical Necessity\n: A Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) is the written explanation from the treating physician describing the medical need for services, equipment, or supplies to assist the claimant in the treatment, care, or relief of their accepted work-related illness(es). [https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance/Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance/Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf)\n\n\nNeurodivergent\n: See Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence\n\n\nNeurodiversity\n: See Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence\n\n\nNon-Speaking\n: When an autistic person doesn’t speak, it’s known as nonspeaking autism. You may also see it described as nonverbal autism. However, the term nonverbal isn’t completely accurate, since it means “without words. Even if an autistic person is nonspeaking, they may still use words in other ways (such as in writing). They may also understand the words that are spoken to them or that they overhear. [https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism](https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism)\n\n\nOCD\n: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning, checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. [https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder)\n\n\nODDS\n: Oregon Office of Developmental Disabilities Services\n\n\nOHP\n: Oregon Health Plan: Oregon Medicaid\n\n\nServices Cliff\n: Many high school students on the autism spectrum get help through special education – most commonly including speech-language therapy, service coordination/case management, behavior management, and special transportation. Each student has a team that works with the student and family to decide which services are needed to prepare him or her for young adulthood, and federal law requires schools to offer the necessary services. Sounds like a good plan for how to help vulnerable youth through a challenging period of life. But then, following the last day of high school, the legal mandate for help suddenly ends.

Note: an individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender identity. [https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions](https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions)\n\n\nSynesthesia\n: Synesthesia is when your brain routes sensory information through multiple unrelated senses, causing you to experience more than one sense simultaneously. Some examples include tasting words or linking colors to numbers and letters. It’s not a medical condition, and many people find it useful to help them learn and remember information. [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia)\n\n\nTheory of Mind\n: In psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others' beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts may be different from one's own. Possessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others' behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person's capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical with having the capacity for empathy or sympathy.
