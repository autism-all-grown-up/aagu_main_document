By conducting root cause analyses and working with local organizations, he identified key areas where AAGU could make an immediate impact, such as:\n\n-   Creating accessible guides for obtaining adult autism diagnoses through Oregon's Medicaid and Vocational Rehabilitation systems\n-   Establishing *The Uncommons*, autism-friendly co-working and community spaces\n-   Improving online resources for autistic adults and providing consulting services to others to do the same\n-   Participating in data analysis and research efforts to better understand the needs of autistic adults in Oregon\n\n## What We Have Started {#sec-aagu_started}\n\nAAGU has already made strides in achieving its objectives through initiatives such as:\n\n-   Partnering with Health Share Oregon to create guides for accessing autism assessments through Medicaid and developing a template Letter of Medical Necessity to facilitate evaluations through I/DD and Vocational Rehab programs\n-   Securing temporary spaces for *The Uncommons*, autism-friendly co-working and community spaces\n-   Consulting with the Autism Society of Oregon to improve their online resources\n-   Participating in the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder's data working group\n-   Planning a State-wide conference to \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n## Goals {#sec-aagu_goals}\n\nAutism All Grown Up (AAGU) seeks to activate and empower the autistic community in Oregon by improving communication channels and information resources. Our immediate actions include:\n\n-   Establishing *The Uncommons*, a meeting and coworking space for autistic adults\n-   Creating comprehensive guides on navigating healthcare, employment, and social services\n-   Building partnerships with local organizations to enhance service delivery\n-   Participating in data analysis and research to inform policy and advocacy efforts\n\nOur growth plan consists of three phases:\n\n1.  Seed (Weeks 1-8): Set up organizational structure, solicit initial funds, establish community presence, and build initial partnerships\n2.  Sprout (Weeks 9-26): Continue building community connections, develop *The Uncommons*, create informational materials, and identify large funding opportunities\n3.  Grow (Beyond Week 26): Expand *The Uncommons*, apply for large grants, build information and communication infrastructure, and establish a sustainable model for ongoing operations\n\n## Growth Plan {#sec-aagu_growth_plan}\n\nOur growth plan consists of three phases:\n\n**1. Seed (Weeks 1-8 approx)**\n\n-   **Budget:** `r seed_per_week`/week, approx `r seed_total` total\n-   **Effort:** 1.5 FTE\n-   **Actions:**\n    -   Set up organizational structure\n    -   Solicit initial funds\n    -   Establish community presence\n    -   Build initial partnerships\n\n**2. Sprout (Weeks 9-26)**\n\n-   **Budget:** `sprout_per_week`/week, `r sprout_total` total\n-   **Effort:** 2.75 FTE\n-   **Actions:**\n    -   Continue building community connections\n    -   Develop *The Uncommons*\n    -   Create informational materials\n    -   Identify large funding opportunities\n\n**3. Grow (Beyond Week 26)**\n\n-   **Budget:** `r grow_per_week`/week, `r grow_total` total\n-   **Effort:** 4.25 FTE\n-   **Actions:**\n    -   Expand *The Uncommons*\n    -   Apply for large grants\n    -   Build information and communication infrastructure\n    -   Establish a sustainable model for ongoing operations\n\nBy establishing a comprehensive support system for autistic adults, AAGU aims to improve their quality of life, promote independence, and foster a sense of community and belonging. Through a phased growth plan, AAGU will continue to expand its reach and impact, with a strong emphasis on hiring autistic individuals and providing them with meaningful employment opportunities. By leveraging the strengths and talents of the autistic community, AAGU is uniquely positioned to create lasting, positive change for autistic adults in Oregon.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","cite-method":"citeproc","number-sections":false,"toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"output-file":"autism_all_grown_up.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
