{"title":"Special Issues and Concerns","markdown":{"headingText":"Special Issues and Concerns","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## The Services Cliff {#sec-services_cliff}\n\n-   Services Cliff: Young autistic adults also face significant challenges transitioning out of high school, often referred to as the \"services cliff.\" This sudden drop-off in support can lead to difficulties in finding meaningful work, pursuing higher education, and living independently. \\[<https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/>\\].\n\nTransition to Adulthood This problem does not just affect existing adults. The sudden drop-off of support upon graduating high school has become known as the services cliff. One of the biggest worries faced by both parents of autistic people and young autistic people themselves is what will happen after they graduate from high school. Will they be offered meaningful work in tolerant and respectful environments? Will they be able to earn enough to live independently? Will they find open doors in trade schools or collegFes and be offered the support they might need?\n\n## Access to Medical Care {#sec-access_to_care}\n\nThere is an immense amount of work to do to help prepare the aging autistic adult community and a poorly informed medical system to successfully face these challenges right now and in the coming decades. Fortunately, there are also many skilled, intelligent, creative, compassionate, and hard-working people in the autistic community who are ready and capable of doing this work. And they are the right people to do it.\n\n## Medical Training {#sec-training_for_providers}\n\nLack of training for healthcare providers\n\n## Autism Research Funding Priorities {#sec-research_funding_providers}\n\nDespite the fact that advocates and researchers have been pushing for decades to have autism research funding focus more on quality of life and less on \"prevention and cure\", the trend has only gotten worse.\n\n![Figure 2. Data from \\[Interagency Autism Coordination Committee\\](https://iacc.hhs.gov/funding/data/)](./media/image1.png){#img-autism_research_funding fig-alt=\"Graph of funding for autism research years 2010 to 2020 by category showing that very little research goes to quality of life issues vs. biology (prevention and cure).\" width=\"5.481101268591426in\"}\n\n## Intersectionally Marginalized Groups {#sec-marginalized}\n\nAll of these problems compound for members of intersectional populations who may already be marginalized along other dimensions. Many researchers believe that autism is [@Fombonne2022], particularly in Black communities [@Angell2018], as well as for [@DMello2022]. Meanwhile, fluidity in gender and sexual orientation [@George2018a; @George2018] is more highly represented among autistic people. Little research has been done to assess how autism uniquely affects people in these different subgroups.\n\n## Physical and Mental Health {#sec-physical_mental_health}\n\n-   Health and Well-being: Autistic adults experience higher rates of mental health issues, physical health disparities, and substantially elevated suicide risk \\[<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00463-7>, <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33407027/>\\].\n-   Social Isolation: Negative social experiences can lead to self-isolation, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and exclusion [@Loomes2017]\n\nAcross a variety of health domains, autistic people fare worse [@LodiSmith2021; @LodiSmith2021a]. Additionally, we are exposed to risks that are not of primary concern for most people [@Muskens2017]. These include autoimmune dysregulation of many kinds, autonomic dysregulation, connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and many other areas of health concern. A lack of understanding regarding these differences, coupled with communication barriers and false notions about autism all collude to create barriers to accessing health services and care.\n\n## Unemployment {#sec-unemployment}\n\n-   Employment: Many autistic adults face difficulties finding and maintaining employment due to biases and lack of accommodations. In a study of 254 autistic adults, 77% reported difficulties applying for jobs, and only 16% are in full-time paid work \\[<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215190/>, <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.719827/full>\\].\n\n## Homelessness {#sec-homelessness}\n\nBarriers to entry to the workplace, as well as challenges and holding jobs due to ablest attitudes or inflexible policies, put us at risk of severe financial strain [@Ohl2017]. This, coupled with the possibility of reduced social support, increases our risk of exposure to homelessness. The few studies that attempted to investigate autism in homeless populations suggest that rates of autism in homeless populations are much higher than that observed in the general public and may be ten times higher [@Churchard2019]. Autistic people additionally face extra barriers in accessing the few services for unhoused people. Environments created with the intention of providing support may be aversive or even harmful for autistic people [@Kargas2019].\n\n## Suicide {#sec-suicide}\n\nAs a group, their suicide risk may be two to seven times higher than the risk for youth and adults who do not have autism. When researchers took into account psychiatric conditions that increase suicide risk, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, autistic people still had a higher risk than the comparison group \\[\\@\\|autism2022\\]. The International Society for Autism Research says \"Suicide in autism is a hidden crisis, overlooked by policymakers, clinicians and researchers worldwide.\" and highlights three barriers: a lack of evidence-based assessment tools and interventions to identify and treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors; a lack of access to mental health services10 and exclusion from conversations about policies and guidelines that affect autistic people.\"
