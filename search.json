    "text": "3.1 Background\nDr. Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD later in life and is raising a teenager with both diagnoses. His desire to understand these challenges led him to study the scientific and social aspects of neurodiversity. Recent changes driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers have reshaped our understanding of autism, revealing significant gaps in support for autistic adults. These changes have led to controversies and arguments that are still unfolding, emphasizing the evolving nature of the understanding of autism.\nThrough his personal journey and interactions with the local autistic community, Dr. Balter identified significant gaps in services, support, and understanding for autistic adults without intellectual disabilities. He was struck by the level of unmet need he heard from his peers—people with skills, education, and abilities but struggling for reasons related to autism. These personal experiences led Dr. Balter to found Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) to address these gaps."

    "text": "3.3 Autism All Grown Up\nAutism is all grown up, and it isn’t pretty. The phrase “All Grown Up” captures the bittersweet realization that often occurs when one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that their preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.\nFor decades, autism was seen as a developmental challenge that primarily affected children. Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism have cause adults to be overlooked by many people. Because so little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some existing research suggests that autistic adults face reduced life expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset of age-related cognitive concerns. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect to aging, and most of these “lost generation[s]” (Wright 2015) have not yet even been counted."

Autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often face a lack of access to appropriate healthcare and support services.\nAutistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While they rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved. Most autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn’t being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in the workplace.\nAutistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Key issues include:\nDespite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table."

Key findings include:\n\nNavigational Challenges: Most autistic individuals are not intellectually disabled but face substantial challenges navigating society. Navigating society feels like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best.\nLifelong Condition: Autism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured. There are roughly the same percentage of autistic adults as children, but there are four times as many adults as children.\nNeurodiversity: The neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Statistically, fewer than half of autistic people are intellectually disabled but may face challenges navigating a neurotypical world. A significant population of autistic adults has needs that are often unmet.\nFocus Gaps: Research and services have predominantly focused on children and intellectually disabled adults, leaving a gap for others. We have failed, and continue to fail, to study autistic life after high school.\nAutism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured.\nMost autistic people are not intellectually or physically disabled but may face substantial challenges.\nThe neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology.

The sudden drop-off of support upon graduating high school has become known as the services cliff. One of the biggest worries faced by both parents of autistic people and young autistic people themselves is what will happen after they graduate from high school. Will they be offered meaningful work in tolerant and respectful environments? Will they be able to earn enough to live independently? Will they find open doors in trade schools or collegFes and be offered the support they might need?\n## Access to Medical Care\nThere is an immense amount of work to do to help prepare the aging autistic adult community and a poorly informed medical system to successfully face these challenges right now and in the coming decades. Fortunately, there are also many skilled, intelligent, creative, compassionate, and hard-working people in the autistic community who are ready and capable of doing this work.
