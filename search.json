    "text": "3.1 Background\nDr. Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD later in life and is raising a teenager with both diagnoses. His desire to understand these challenges led him to study the scientific and social aspects of neurodiversity. Recent changes driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers have reshaped our understanding of autism, revealing significant gaps in support for autistic adults. These changes have led to controversies and arguments that are still unfolding, emphasizing the evolving nature of the understanding of autism.\nThrough his personal journey and interactions with the local autistic community, Dr. Balter identified significant gaps in services, support, and understanding for autistic adults without intellectual disabilities. He was struck by the level of unmet need he heard from his peers—people with skills, education, and abilities but struggling for reasons related to autism. These personal experiences led Dr. Balter to found Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) to address these gaps."

    "text": "3.3 Autism All Grown Up\nAutism is all grown up, and it isn’t pretty. The phrase “All Grown Up” captures the bittersweet realization that often occurs when one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that their preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.\nFor decades, autism was seen as a developmental challenge that primarily affected children. Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism have cause adults to be overlooked by many people. Because so little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some existing research suggests that autistic adults face reduced life expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset of age-related cognitive concerns. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect to aging, and most of these “lost generations” (Wright 2015) have not yet even been counted."

Systemic and societal problems can only be addressed through advocacy. But many of the real-world problems faced by supporting existing infrastructure by increasing the connectivity and information flow. Rather than being a hub that consumes resources and provides services, AAGU will catalyze and strengthen relationships around it to form a nexus.\n\n\n\n\nWright, Jessica. 2015. “Autism’s Lost Generation.”"

    "text": "4.1 The New World of Autism\nRecent advancements in autism research, largely driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers, have highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in understanding and supporting autistic individuals. Key findings include:\n\nNavigational Challenges: Most autistic individuals are not intellectually disabled but face substantial challenges navigating society. Navigating society feels like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best.\nLifelong Condition: Autism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured. There are roughly the same percentage of autistic adults as children, but there are four times as many adults as children.\nNeurodiversity: The neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Statistically, fewer than half of autistic people are intellectually disabled but may face challenges navigating a neurotypical world. A significant population of autistic adults has needs that are often unmet.\nFocus Gaps: Research and services have predominantly focused on children and intellectually disabled adults, leaving a gap for others. We have failed, and continue to fail, to study autistic life after high school.\nAutism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured.\nMost autistic people are not intellectually or physically disabled but may face substantial challenges.\nThe neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. For many autistic people, the hardest part about being autistic is navigating a neurotypical world.\nResearch and services have predominantly focused on children leaving out adults, especially those without profound disabilities."

Autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often face a lack of access to appropriate healthcare and support services.\nAutistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While they rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved. Most autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn’t being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in the workplace.\nAutistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Key issues include:\nDespite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table."

The urgency is palpable as we aim to raise a substantial seed fund of $2k-$3k per week, a total of $ 34k, to kickstart our formal operations. This will pave the way for our 8-week Sprout phase, which we plan to initiate within our first month.\nOur initial 8 weeks of formal operation, known as the Sprout phase, are meticulously planned. We will create a comprehensive calendar of funding deadlines and engage in proactive communication with funders to prioritize our grant-writing efforts. Equally important is the completion of our initial projects during this phase, which will serve as tangible proof of our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the end of the Sprout phase, we will provide a detailed report to our umbrella organizations and all funders/sponsors.\nWe have already identified almost 100 grants and sponsorships for which we meet the basic requirements. These include grants from the State of Oregon (e.g. Oregon Health Authority), Oregon healthcare companies (Legacy, Pacific Source, Cambia, etc.), and a mixture of private and public foundations and trusts. We have missed the 2024 funding cycle for some of these, but many have multiple cycles per year or do not run in cycles. Some of these are small pots of money, and others regularly award hundreds of thousands of dollars. We will also collect sliding-scale fees for using The Uncommons co-working spaces.\nDuring our Grow phase, we hope to show that we can collect, analyze, and disseminate information for and about the adult autistic community with a very high level of capacity and efficiency. We hope this expertise will enable us to secure outside contracts as subject matter experts, analysts, and report writers, providing another avenue for revenue. We will complete the Grow phase with a report to our umbrella organization and our financial supporters."

    "text": "What the autism spectrum means.\n\n\n\nB The Services Cliff\n\nServices Cliff: Young autistic adults also face significant challenges transitioning out of high school, often referred to as the “services cliff.” This sudden drop-off in support can lead to difficulties in finding meaningful work, pursuing higher education, and living independently. [https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/].\n\nTransition to Adulthood This problem does not just affect existing adults. The sudden drop-off of support upon graduating high school has become known as the services cliff. One of the biggest worries faced by both parents of autistic people and young autistic people themselves is what will happen after they graduate from high school. Will they be offered meaningful work in tolerant and respectful environments? Will they be able to earn enough to live independently? Will they find open doors in trade schools or collegFes and be offered the support they might need?\n\n\nC Access to Medical Care\nThere is an immense amount of work to do to help prepare the aging autistic adult community and a poorly informed medical system to successfully face these challenges right now and in the coming decades. Fortunately, there are also many skilled, intelligent, creative, compassionate, and hard-working people in the autistic community who are ready and capable of doing this work. And they are the right people to do it.\n\n\nD Medical Training\nLack of training for healthcare providers\n\n\nE Autism Research Funding Priorities\nDespite the fact that advocates and researchers have been pushing for decades to have autism research funding focus more on quality of life and less on “prevention and cure”, the trend has only gotten worse.\n\nFigure 2. Data from Interagency Autism Coordination Committee\n\n\nF Intersectionally marginalized Groups\nAll of these problems compound for members of intersectional populations who may already be marginalized along other dimensions. Many researchers believe that autism is (Fombonne and Zuckerman 2022), particularly in Black communities (Angell, Empey, and Zuckerman 2018), as well as for (D’Mello et al. 2022). Meanwhile, fluidity in gender and sexual orientation Rita George and Stokes (2018) is more highly represented among autistic people. Little research has been done to assess how autism uniquely affects people in these different subgroups.\n\n\nG Physical and Mental Health\n\nHealth and Well-being: Autistic adults experience higher rates of mental health issues, physical health disparities, and substantially elevated suicide risk [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00463-7, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33407027/].\nSocial Isolation: Negative social experiences can lead to self-isolation, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and exclusion (Loomes, Hull, and Mandy 2017)\n\nAcross a variety of health domains, autistic people fare worse Lodi-Smith, Rodgers, et al. (2021). Additionally, we are exposed to risks that are not of primary concern for most people (Muskens, Velders, and Staal 2017). These include autoimmune dysregulation of many kinds, autonomic dysregulation, connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and many other areas of health concerns. A lack of understanding regarding these differences, coupled with communication barriers and false notions about autism all collude to create barriers to accessing health services and care.\n\n\nH Unemployment\n\nEmployment: Many autistic adults face difficulties finding and maintaining employment due to biases and lack of accommodations. In a study of 254 autistic adults, 77% reported difficulties applying for jobs, and only 16% are in full-time paid work [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215190/, https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.719827/full].\n\n\n\nI Homelessness\nBarriers to entry to the workplace as well as challenges and holding jobs due to ablest attitudes or inflexible policies put us at risk of severe financial strain (Ohl et al. 2017). This coupled with the possibility of reduced social support all increase our risk of exposure to homelessness. The few studies that attempted to investigate autism in homeless populations suggest that rates of autism in homeless populations is much higher than that observed in the general public, and may be ten times higher (Churchard et al. 2019). Autistic people additionally face extra barriers in accessing the few services for unhoused people. Environments created with the intention of providing support may be aversive or even harmful for autistic people (Kargas et al. 2019).\n\n\nJ Suicide\nAs a group, their suicide risk may be two to seven times higher than the risk for youth and adults who do not have autism. When researchers took into account psychiatric conditions that increase suicide risk, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, autistic people still had a higher risk than the comparison group [@|autism2022]. The International Society for Autism Research says “Suicide in autism is a hidden crisis, overlooked by policymakers, clinicians and researchers worldwide.” and highlights three barriers: a lack of evidence-based assessment tools and interventions to identify and treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors; a lack of access to mental health services10 and exclusion from conversations about policies and guidelines that affect autistic people.” (Cassidy et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\nAngell, Amber M., Allison Empey, and Katharine E.

    "text": "Term\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nADLs\nWhen a person applies for Medicaid long-term care services in Oregon, we look at how much help they need to perform Activities of Daily Living. Because funding is limited, we use this information (called a service priority level) to decide who is eligible for services. Activities of Daily Living are the basic personal activities all of us need to do that are essential for health and safety. These activities are defined in OAR 411-015-0006 https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-servi ces/p ages/adl.aspx\n\n\n\n*A lexithymia**\n\nAlexithymia is the inability for someone to recognize, identify, and describe feelings or emotions. It is sometimes referred to as emotional blindness. [https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963]{.unde r line}\n\n\nAsperger’s Syndrome\nAsperger’s syndrome (sometimes called high-functioning autism) is part of a wide diagnosis called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since 2013, Asperger’s syndrome is replaced by the broader diagnosis of ASD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) revised criteria. h t tps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436- asper ger-syndrome\n\n\nCo-Occurring Conditions\nThe preferred term in the autistic community as a replacement for “comorbid” for conditions, traits, and behaviors that are commonly found along with autism.\n\n\nDouble Empathy\nDouble empathy refers to how:\n1. It is easier to understand the mindset of people who are similar to you\n2. It is more difficult to understand the mindset of those who are different from you\nThis concept was specifically developed by the autistic autism researcher Damian Milton to explain how autistics and neurotypicals empathize with each other. It explains how allistics (non-autistics) struggle to understand the lived experiences of autistics and autistics struggle to understand the lived experiences of allistics. Likewise, autistics are better at understanding other autistics and allistics are better at understanding other allistics. https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-the-do uble- empathy-problem/\n\n\nDyslexia\nDyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which primarily affects reading and writing skills. However, it does not only affect these skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills. It is important to remember that there are positives to thinking differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as reasoning and in visual and creative fields. https : //www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/w hat-i s-dyslexia\n\n\nDyspraxia\nDyspraxia is a term that refers to lifelong trouble with movement and coordination. It’s not a formal diagnosis. But you may still hear people use this term, especially in the U.K. The formal diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder (DCD). https://www.understood.org/en/articles /unde rstanding-dyspraxia\n\n\nfMRI\nFunctional MRI is a type of MRI scan that can show which areas of your brain are most active. Tracking and comparing that activity to what you were doing at the time can help “map” your brain activity. It’s most often used for planning surgery or similar procedures in the brain. https://my.cl e velandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-function al-mr i-fmri\n\n\nGender identity\nOne’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One’s gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth. [http s ://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-ge n der-identity-terminology-and-definitions]{.underli ne}\n\n\nGenome\nThe genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the cell’s nucleus, as well as a small chromosome in the cell’s mitochondria. A genome contains all the information needed for an individual to develop and function. https:// ww w.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome\n\n\nHealth Share Oregon\nOne of Oregon’s Community Care Organizations (CCO) for OHP. https://www.healthshareoregon.org /\n\n\nI/DD\nOregon Department of Human Services: Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\nLetter of Medical Necessity\nA Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) is the written explanation from the treating physician describing the medical need for services, equipment, or supplies to assist the claimant in the treatment, care, or relief of their accepted work-related illness(es). https://www.dol . gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance / Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf\n\n\nNe urodivergent\n\n\n\nNe urodiversity\n\n\n\nNon-Speaking\nWhen an autistic person doesn’t speak, it’s known as nonspeaking autism. You may also see it described as nonverbal autism. However, the term nonverbal isn’t completely accurate, since it means “without words. Even if an autistic person is nonspeaking, they may still use words in other ways (such as in writing). They may also understand the words that are spoken to them or that they overhear. https: / /www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism\n\n\nOCD\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning, checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. https://ww w .psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compul s ive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder\n\n\nODDS\nOregon Office of Developmental Disabilities Services\n\n\nOHP\nOregon Health Plan: Oregon Medicaid\n\n\nServices Cliff\nMany high school students on the autism spectrum get help through special education – most commonly including speech-language therapy, service coordination/case management, behavior management, and special transportation. Each student has a team that works with the student and family to decide which services are needed to prepare him or her for young adulthood, and federal law requires schools to offer the necessary services. Sounds like a good plan for how to help vulnerable youth through a challenging period of life. But then, following the last day of high school, the legal mandate for help suddenly ends. [https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overvi e w/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/]{.un derli ne}\n\n\nSexual orientation\nAn inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people. Note: an individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender identity. [http s ://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-ge n der-identity-terminology-and-definitions]{.underli ne}\n\n\n\n*S ynesthesia**\n\nSynesthesia is when your brain routes sensory information through multiple unrelated senses, causing you to experience more than one sense simultaneously. Some examples include tasting words or linking colors to numbers and letters. It’s not a medical condition, and many people find it useful to help them learn and remember information. https://my.cl e velandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia\n\n\nTheory of Mind\nIn psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others’ beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts may be different from one’s own. Possessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others’ behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person’s capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical with having the capacity for empathy or sympathy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind\n\n\n\n\nD"

    "section": "F.1 Neurodiversity (concept)",
    "text": "F.1 Neurodiversity (concept)\nDefinition: Neurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and others, are natural variations of the human genome. This concept emphasizes that these differences should be recognized and respected as a part of human diversity.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurodiversity” was coined in the late 1990s by sociologist Judy Singer. It arose from the disability rights movement and the autistic rights movement, which sought to challenge the medical model of disability that views neurological differences as deficits or disorders to be cured. Instead, neurodiversity advocates promote acceptance and understanding, emphasizing the strengths and contributions of neurodivergent individuals."

    "text": "F.2 Neurodiversity (paradigm)\nDefinition: The neurodiversity paradigm is a framework that challenges traditional views of neurological differences. It posits that these differences should be seen as normal variations rather than abnormalities or deficits. This paradigm promotes the idea that society should adapt to accommodate these differences rather than forcing individuals to conform to a neurotypical standard.\nHistorical and Social Context: This paradigm shift gained momentum in the early 2000s, aligning with broader social movements advocating for civil rights and inclusion. It has influenced fields like education, employment, and healthcare, encouraging practices that support diverse ways of thinking and learning."

    "text": "F.3 Neurodiversity (movement)\nDefinition: The neurodiversity movement is a social movement that advocates for the rights and inclusion of neurodivergent individuals. It seeks to promote understanding, acceptance, and accommodation of neurological differences. The movement has worked to reframe autism as a minority identity rather than a disorder.\nHistorical and Social Context: Emerging in the late 20th century, the neurodiversity movement has been driven by self-advocates and allies. It challenges stigmatizing narratives and calls for systemic changes in how neurodivergent individuals are treated in society. This movement has led to increased visibility and advocacy for policies that support neurodiversity in schools, workplaces, and communities."

    "text": "F.4 Neurodivergence\nDefinition: Neurodivergence refers to the state of having a brain that functions differently from the typical standards of society. It is an umbrella term that includes various neurological conditions like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurodivergence” gained prominence alongside the neurodiversity movement. It helps to create a more inclusive language that recognizes the spectrum of neurological differences without implying pathology. This shift in terminology supports a more positive and accepting view of diverse cognitive profiles."

This term is used to identify people who have conditions like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.\nHistorical and Social Context: The adoption of the term “neurodivergent” reflects a growing acceptance of diversity in neurological functioning. It emphasizes identity and self-advocacy, allowing individuals to claim their differences as part of who they are rather than as something to be fixed or hidden."

    "text": "F.6 Neurotypical\nDefinition: Neurotypical refers to individuals whose neurological development and functioning are considered standard or typical by societal norms. It is often used in contrast to neurodivergent.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurotypical” originated within the neurodiversity community as a way to distinguish between those who conform to societal norms of neurological functioning and those who do not. It highlights that “typical” neurological functioning is not the only valid or acceptable way of being, promoting a more inclusive view of human diversity.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Singer, J. (1998).
