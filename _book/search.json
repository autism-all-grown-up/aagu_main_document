    "text": "Background\nDr. Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD later in life and is raising a teenager with both diagnoses. His desire to understand these challenges led him to study the scientific and social aspects of neurodiversity. Recent changes driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers have reshaped our understanding of autism, revealing significant gaps in support for autistic adults. These changes have led to controversies and arguments that are still unfolding, emphasizing the evolving nature of the understanding of autism.\nThrough his personal journey and interactions with the local autistic community, Dr. Balter identified significant gaps in services, support, and understanding for autistic adults without intellectual disabilities. He was struck by the level of unmet need he heard from his peers—people with skills, education, and abilities but struggling for reasons related to autism. These personal experiences led Dr. Balter to found Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) to address these gaps.",

    "text": "Autism All Grown Up\nAutism is all grown up now, and it isn’t always pretty. The phrase “All Grown Up” captures the bittersweet realization that often occurs when one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that their preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.\nFor decades, autism was seen as a challenge that primarily affected children. Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism have caused adults to be overlooked by key stakeholders. Because so little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some existing research suggests that autistic adults face reduced life expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset of age-related cognitive concerns1,2. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect to aging, and most of these “lost generations”3–6 have not yet even been identified, accounted for, or documented.",

Systemic and societal problems can only be addressed through advocacy.

What the autism spectrum means.\n\n\n\n\nMisconceptions: New research has reshaped our understanding of autism and refuted many harmful misconceptions. Some autistic people do have accompanying conditions that can result in problems with body awareness, identifying their emotional state, or using speech. However, autistic people do not intrinsically lack feelings, empathy, social skills, or the ability to communicate {{citations: autistic people sociability}}.\nAlso, by the most current estimates, less than 1/3 of autistic people have intellectual or cognitive difficulties{{citations: rates of ID}}. Many autistic people who are unable to speak (for one or more reasons) do have language skills and can be competent writers and speakers with assistive technology {{citations: language}}.\nDisability can be Contextual: Most autistic individuals are not intellectually or physically disabled but face substantial challenges navigating a neurotypical world. It can feel like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best. {{something about not wanting to be cured just have life easier}} {{citations}}\nNot Just in the Brain: Autism frequently comes with physiological differences that are just beginning to be understood and studied{{citations: co-occurring physical}}. Autistic people may experience higher or lower risk for certain diseases and conditions as well as different levels of physical abilities like flexibility.

Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in society10, especially in the workplace11,12.\nNeurodiversity & Neurodivergence: The neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Individuals with significantly atypical neurotypes are neurodivergent, and sometimes need different things than neurotypical people do. These terms are not scientific and can sometimes lead to confusion: see Appendix E — Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence.",

These include grants from the State of Oregon (e.g. Oregon Health Authority), Oregon healthcare companies (Legacy, Pacific Source, Cambia, etc.), and a mixture of private and public foundations and trusts. We have missed the 2024 funding cycle for some of these, but many have multiple cycles per year or do not run in cycles. Some of these are small pots of money, and others regularly award hundreds of thousands of dollars. We will also collect sliding-scale fees for using The Uncommons co-working spaces.\nDuring our Grow phase, we hope to show that we can collect, analyze, and disseminate information for and about the adult autistic community with a very high level of capacity and efficiency.

The International Society for Autism Research says “Suicide in autism is a hidden crisis, overlooked by policymakers, clinicians and researchers worldwide.” and highlights three barriers: a lack of evidence-based assessment tools and interventions to identify and treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors; a lack of access to mental health services10 and exclusion from conversations about policies and guidelines that affect autistic people.”13\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "section": "",
    "text": "ADLs\n\nWhen a person applies for Medicaid long-term care services in Oregon, we look at how much help they need to perform Activities of Daily Living. Because funding is limited, we use this information (called a service priority level) to decide who is eligible for services. Activities of Daily Living are the basic personal activities all of us need to do that are essential for health and safety. These activities are defined in OAR 411-015-0006 https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-services/pages/adl.aspx\n\nAlexithymia\n\nAlexithymia is the inability for someone to recognize, identify, and describe feelings or emotions. It is sometimes referred to as emotional blindness. https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963\n\nAsperger’s Syndrome\n\nAsperger’s syndrome (sometimes called high-functioning autism) is part of a wide diagnosis called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since 2013, Asperger’s syndrome is replaced by the broader diagnosis of ASD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) revised criteria. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436-asperger-syndrome\n\nCo-Occurring Conditions\n\nThe preferred term in the autistic community as a replacement for “comorbid” for conditions, traits, and behaviors that are commonly found along with autism.\n\nDouble Empathy\n\nDouble empathy refers to how: 1. It is easier to understand the mindset of people who are similar to you 2. It is more difficult to understand the mindset of those who are different from you This concept was specifically developed by the autistic autism researcher Damian Milton to explain how autistics and neurotypicals empathize with each other. It explains how allistics (non-autistics) struggle to understand the lived experiences of autistics and autistics struggle to understand the lived experiences of allistics. Likewise, autistics are better at understanding other autistics and allistics are better at understanding other allistics. https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-the-double-empathy-problem/\n\nDyslexia\n\nDyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which primarily affects reading and writing skills. However, it does not only affect these skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills. It is important to remember that there are positives to thinking differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as reasoning and in visual and creative fields. https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia\n\nDyspraxia\n\nDyspraxia is a term that refers to lifelong trouble with movement and coordination. It’s not a formal diagnosis. But you may still hear people use this term, especially in the U.K. The formal diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder (DCD). https://www.understood.org/en/articles/understanding-dyspraxia\n\nfMRI\n\nFunctional MRI is a type of MRI scan that can show which areas of your brain are most active. Tracking and comparing that activity to what you were doing at the time can help “map” your brain activity. It’s most often used for planning surgery or similar procedures in the brain. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri\n\nGender identity\n\nOne’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One’s gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth. https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions\n\nGenome\n\nThe genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the cell’s nucleus, as well as a small chromosome in the cell’s mitochondria. A genome contains all the information needed for an individual to develop and function. https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome\n\nHealth Share Oregon\n\nOne of Oregon’s Community Care Organizations (CCO) for OHP. https://www.healthshareoregon.org/\n\nI/DD\n\nOregon Department of Human Services: Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n\nLetter of Medical Necessity\n\nA Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) is the written explanation from the treating physician describing the medical need for services, equipment, or supplies to assist the claimant in the treatment, care, or relief of their accepted work-related illness(es). https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance/Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf\n\nNeurodivergent\n\nSee Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence\n\nNeurodiversity\n\nSee Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence\n\nNon-Speaking\n\nWhen an autistic person doesn’t speak, it’s known as nonspeaking autism. You may also see it described as nonverbal autism. However, the term nonverbal isn’t completely accurate, since it means “without words. Even if an autistic person is nonspeaking, they may still use words in other ways (such as in writing). They may also understand the words that are spoken to them or that they overhear. https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism\n\nOCD\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning, checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder\n\nODDS\n\nOregon Office of Developmental Disabilities Services\n\nOHP\n\nOregon Health Plan: Oregon Medicaid\n\nServices Cliff\n\nMany high school students on the autism spectrum get help through special education – most commonly including speech-language therapy, service coordination/case management, behavior management, and special transportation. Each student has a team that works with the student and family to decide which services are needed to prepare him or her for young adulthood, and federal law requires schools to offer the necessary services. Sounds like a good plan for how to help vulnerable youth through a challenging period of life. But then, following the last day of high school, the legal mandate for help suddenly ends. https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/\n\nSexual orientation\n\nAn inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people. Note: an individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender identity. https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions\n\nSynesthesia\n\nSynesthesia is when your brain routes sensory information through multiple unrelated senses, causing you to experience more than one sense simultaneously. Some examples include tasting words or linking colors to numbers and letters. It’s not a medical condition, and many people find it useful to help them learn and remember information. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia\n\nTheory of Mind\n\nIn psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others’ beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts may be different from one’s own. Possessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others’ behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person’s capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical with having the capacity for empathy or sympathy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind",

This concept emphasizes that these differences should be recognized and respected as a part of human diversity.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurodiversity” was coined in the late 1990s by sociologist Judy Singer. It arose from the disability rights movement and the autistic rights movement, which sought to challenge the medical model of disability that views neurological differences as deficits or disorders to be cured.
