    "text": "Background\nDr. Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD later in life and is raising a teenager with both diagnoses. His desire to understand these challenges led him to study the scientific and social aspects of neurodiversity. Recent changes driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers have reshaped our understanding of autism, revealing significant gaps in support for autistic adults. These changes have led to controversies and arguments that are still unfolding, emphasizing the evolving nature of the understanding of autism.\nThrough his personal journey and interactions with the local autistic community, Dr. Balter identified significant gaps in services, support, and understanding for autistic adults without intellectual disabilities. He was struck by the level of unmet need he heard from his peers—people with skills, education, and abilities but struggling for reasons related to autism. These personal experiences led Dr. Balter to found Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) to address these gaps.",

    "text": "Autism All Grown Up\nAutism is all grown up now, and it isn’t always pretty. The phrase “All Grown Up” captures the bittersweet realization that often occurs when one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that their preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.\nFor decades, autism was seen as a challenge that primarily affected children. Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism have caused adults to be overlooked by key stakeholders. Because so little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some existing research suggests that autistic adults face reduced life expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset of age-related cognitive concerns1,2. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect to aging, and most of these “lost generations”3–6 have not yet even been identified, accounted for, or documented.",

Systemic and societal problems can only be addressed through advocacy. But many of the real-world problems can be solved without waiting for systemic changes by increasing the connectivity and information flow within existing infrastructure. Rather than being a hub that consumes resources and provides services, AAGU will catalyze and strengthen relationships around it to form a nexus.\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "Lifelong Condition: Autism is neurodevelopmental and largely genetic in origin. Although the strength and number of autistic traits they display may vary over time, an autistic person is born with differences that will last their entire life.\nThe Autism Spectrum is not Linear: Autistic people aren’t “more” or “less” autistic so much as they are autistic in different ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Figure 1. What the autism spectrum means.\n\n\n\n\nMisconceptions: New research has reshaped our understanding of autism and refuted many harmful misconceptions. Some autistic people do have accompanying conditions that can result in problems with body awareness, identifying their emotional state, or using speech. However, autistic people do not intrinsically lack feelings, empathy, social skills, or the ability to communicate3,4. Many autistic people who are unable to speak (for one or more reasons) do have language skills and can be competent writers and speakers with assistive technology5–7.\n\nThe medical establishment once considered autism and intellectual disability to be virtually inseparable. In the 1980s, as much as 69 percent of people with an autism diagnosis also had a diagnosis of [intellectual disability]. By 2014, the figure for a dual diagnosis…had declined to 30 percent, as researchers had sharpened the diagnostic criteria for autism.”8.\n\nAutistic in Body and Mind: Autism frequently comes with physiological differences that are just beginning to be understood and studied9–11. Autistic people may experience higher or lower risk for certain diseases and conditions as well as different levels of physical abilities like flexibility. Many autistic people experience pain and other sensations differently.12,13 Few doctors are aware of these issues, and most are poorly trained in most aspects of supporting autistic patients.14–16\nDisability can be Contextual: Most autistic individuals are not intellectually or physically disabled but face substantial challenges navigating a neurotypical world. It can feel like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best. According to research, most autistic people do not desire to be “cured”, “fixed”. Instead, autistic people seek a life where they can exercise self-determination, and engage in meaningful social activities, self-actualization, and employment within an inclusive society that respects their neurodivergence and values their authentic selves17.\nDouble Empathy: The double empathy problem in autism is a theory that goes against the common belief that autistic people don’t have empathy. Instead, it says that communication problems are caused by autistic and non-autistic people not understanding each other. This isn’t because autistic people can’t talk to each other; it’s because they use two different communication styles that are hard for each other to understand18,19.\nThe True Challenges: Many autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn’t being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism20–26. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in society27, especially in the workplace28,29.\nNeurodiversity & Neurodivergence: The neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Individuals with significantly atypical neurotypes are termed neurodivergent, and sometimes need different things than neurotypical people do. These terms are not scientific and can sometimes lead to confusion: see Appendix E — Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence.",

But past research and services have predominantly focused on children and neglected the needs of adults, especially those of us without profound disabilities.

Autistic people possess a variety of strengths and abilities that can be highly valuable in both personal and professional settings. Research highlights that autistic individuals often exhibit exceptional cognitive abilities, such as superior creativity, focus, and memory, which can lead to increased efficiency and unique perspectives in the workplace34–37. These cognitive strengths are complemented by personal qualities like honesty, dedication, and a strong sense of integrity, making them reliable and trustworthy members of society. In contrast to the prevalent focus of helping autistic people “overcome disabilities”, strengths-based interventions have been shown to improve mental health outcomes, increase knowledge in areas of interest, and promote positive social engagement and self-advocacy among autistic individuals38–41.",

We hope to raise seed money of $2k-$3k per week to jump start formal operations ************* next $34k for our 8-week Sprout phase. We hope to launch the Sprout phase within our first month.\nA key element of our first 8 weeks of formal operation (Sprout) will be to create a calendar of funding deadlines and communicate with funders to prioritize our initial grant-writing efforts. It will also be crucial that we complete the initial projects we have started during the Sprout phase to demonstrate our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the end of the Sprout phase, we will report to our umbrella organizations and all funders/sponsors.\nWe are on the verge of launching a GoFundMe crowdsource campaign, a crucial step that hinges on our nonprofit status being confirmed by ARRO. The urgency is palpable as we aim to raise a substantial seed fund of $2k-$3k per week, a total of $34k, to kickstart our formal operations. This will pave the way for our 8-week Sprout phase, which we plan to initiate within our first month.\nOur initial 8 weeks of formal operation, known as the Sprout phase, are meticulously planned. We will create a comprehensive calendar of funding deadlines and proactively communicate with funders to prioritize our grant-writing efforts. Equally important is the completion of our initial projects during this phase, which will serve as tangible proof of our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the end of the Sprout phase, we will provide a detailed report to our umbrella organizations and all funders/sponsors.\nWe have already identified almost 100 grants and sponsorships (see Appendix D — Potential Funders) for which we meet the basic requirements. These include grants from the State of Oregon (e.g. Oregon Health Authority), Oregon healthcare companies (Legacy, Pacific Source, Cambia, etc.), and a mixture of private and public foundations and trusts. We have missed the 2024 funding cycle for some of these, but many have multiple cycles per year or do not run in cycles. Some of these are small pots of money, and others regularly award hundreds of thousands of dollars. We will also collect sliding-scale fees for using The Uncommons co-working spaces.\nDuring our Grow phase, we hope to show that we can collect, analyze, and disseminate information for and about the adult autistic community with a very high level of capacity and efficiency. We hope this expertise will enable us to secure outside contracts as subject matter experts, analysts, and report writers, providing another avenue for revenue. We will complete the Grow phase with a report to our umbrella organization and our financial supporters.",

    "text": "Suicide\nAs a group, their suicide risk may be two to seven times higher than the risk for youth and adults who do not have autism. When researchers took into account psychiatric conditions that increase suicide risk, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, autistic people still had a higher risk than the comparison group [@|autism2022]. The International Society for Autism Research says “Suicide in autism is a hidden crisis, overlooked by policymakers, clinicians and researchers worldwide.” and highlights three barriers: a lack of evidence-based assessment tools and interventions to identify and treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors; a lack of access to mental health services10 and exclusion from conversations about policies and guidelines that affect autistic people.”13\nAlso, the presumed prevalence of intellectual disability co-occurring with autism (dual diagnosis) has changed along with our understanding of both autism and intellectual disability. While, some research has found selection bias against dual-diagnosis in autism research14, it is also true that difficulties with learning used to be our primary motivation for evaluating children. We have also revised our understanding of speech capability as an indicator of intelligence. The presumed prevalence of intellectual disability co-occurring with autism (dual diagnosis) has changed along with our understanding of both autism and intellectual disability. On the one hand, some research has found selection bias against dual-diagnosis in autism research14. On the other hand, difficulties with learning used to be our primary motivation for evaluating children. We have also revised our understanding of speech capability as an indicator of intelligence. “The medical establishment once considered autism and intellectual disability to be virtually inseparable. In the 1980s, as much as 69 percent of people with an autism diagnosis also had a diagnosis of [intellectual disability]. By 2014, the figure for a dual diagnosis…had declined to 30 percent, as researchers had sharpened the diagnostic criteria for autism.”15.\n\n\n\n\n1. Fombonne E, Zuckerman KE.

    "text": "ADLs\n\nWhen a person applies for Medicaid long-term care services in Oregon, we look at how much help they need to perform Activities of Daily Living. Because funding is limited, we use this information (called a service priority level) to decide who is eligible for services. Activities of Daily Living are the basic personal activities all of us need to do that are essential for health and safety. These activities are defined in OAR 411-015-0006 https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-services/pages/adl.aspx\n\nAlexithymia\n\nAlexithymia is the inability for someone to recognize, identify, and describe feelings or emotions. It is sometimes referred to as emotional blindness. https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963\n\nAsperger’s Syndrome\n\nAsperger’s syndrome (sometimes called high-functioning autism) is part of a wide diagnosis called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since 2013, Asperger’s syndrome is replaced by the broader diagnosis of ASD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) revised criteria. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436-asperger-syndrome\n\nCo-Occurring Conditions\n\nThe preferred term in the autistic community as a replacement for “comorbid” for conditions, traits, and behaviors that are commonly found along with autism.\n\nDouble Empathy\n\nDouble empathy refers to how: 1. It is easier to understand the mindset of people who are similar to you 2. It is more difficult to understand the mindset of those who are different from you This concept was specifically developed by the autistic autism researcher Damian Milton to explain how autistics and neurotypicals empathize with each other. It explains how allistics (non-autistics) struggle to understand the lived experiences of autistics and autistics struggle to understand the lived experiences of allistics. Likewise, autistics are better at understanding other autistics and allistics are better at understanding other allistics. https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-the-double-empathy-problem/\n\nDyslexia\n\nDyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which primarily affects reading and writing skills. However, it does not only affect these skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills. It is important to remember that there are positives to thinking differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as reasoning and in visual and creative fields. https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia\n\nDyspraxia\n\nDyspraxia is a term that refers to lifelong trouble with movement and coordination. It’s not a formal diagnosis. But you may still hear people use this term, especially in the U.K. The formal diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder (DCD). https://www.understood.org/en/articles/understanding-dyspraxia\n\nfMRI\n\nFunctional MRI is a type of MRI scan that can show which areas of your brain are most active. Tracking and comparing that activity to what you were doing at the time can help “map” your brain activity. It’s most often used for planning surgery or similar procedures in the brain. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri\n\nGender identity\n\nOne’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One’s gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth. https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions\n\nGenome\n\nThe genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the cell’s nucleus, as well as a small chromosome in the cell’s mitochondria. A genome contains all the information needed for an individual to develop and function. https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome\n\nHealth Share Oregon\n\nOne of Oregon’s Community Care Organizations (CCO) for OHP. https://www.healthshareoregon.org/\n\nI/DD\n\nOregon Department of Human Services: Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n\nLetter of Medical Necessity\n\nA Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) is the written explanation from the treating physician describing the medical need for services, equipment, or supplies to assist the claimant in the treatment, care, or relief of their accepted work-related illness(es). https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance/Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf\n\nNeurodivergent\n\nSee Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence\n\nNeurodiversity\n\nSee Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence\n\nNon-Speaking\n\nWhen an autistic person doesn’t speak, it’s known as nonspeaking autism. You may also see it described as nonverbal autism. However, the term nonverbal isn’t completely accurate, since it means “without words. Even if an autistic person is nonspeaking, they may still use words in other ways (such as in writing). They may also understand the words that are spoken to them or that they overhear. https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism\n\nOCD\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning, checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder\n\nODDS\n\nOregon Office of Developmental Disabilities Services\n\nOHP\n\nOregon Health Plan: Oregon Medicaid\n\nServices Cliff\n\nMany high school students on the autism spectrum get help through special education – most commonly including speech-language therapy, service coordination/case management, behavior management, and special transportation. Each student has a team that works with the student and family to decide which services are needed to prepare him or her for young adulthood, and federal law requires schools to offer the necessary services. Sounds like a good plan for how to help vulnerable youth through a challenging period of life. But then, following the last day of high school, the legal mandate for help suddenly ends. https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/\n\nSexual orientation\n\nAn inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people. Note: an individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender identity. https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions\n\nSynesthesia\n\nSynesthesia is when your brain routes sensory information through multiple unrelated senses, causing you to experience more than one sense simultaneously. Some examples include tasting words or linking colors to numbers and letters. It’s not a medical condition, and many people find it useful to help them learn and remember information. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia\n\nTheory of Mind\n\nIn psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others’ beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts may be different from one’s own. Possessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others’ behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person’s capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical with having the capacity for empathy or sympathy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind",

This concept emphasizes that these differences should be recognized and respected as a part of human diversity.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurodiversity” is closely associated with Judy Singer who popularized it in the late 1990s1. (There is some current disputation about who invented the concept and/or coined the term2.) It arose from the disability rights movement and the autistic rights movement, which sought to challenge the medical model of disability that views neurological differences as deficits or disorders to be cured3.
