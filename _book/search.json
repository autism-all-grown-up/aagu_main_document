    "text": "Background\nDr. Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD later in life and is raising a teenager with both diagnoses. His desire to understand these challenges led him to study the scientific and social aspects of neurodiversity. Recent changes driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers have reshaped our understanding of autism, revealing significant gaps in support for autistic adults. These changes have led to controversies and arguments that are still unfolding, emphasizing the evolving nature of the understanding of autism.\nThrough his personal journey and interactions with the local autistic community, Dr. Balter identified significant gaps in services, support, and understanding for autistic adults without intellectual disabilities. He was struck by the level of unmet need he heard from his peers—people with skills, education, and abilities but struggling for reasons related to autism. These personal experiences led Dr. Balter to found Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) to address these gaps."

    "text": "Autism All Grown Up\nAutism is all grown up, and it isn’t pretty. The phrase “All Grown Up” captures the bittersweet realization that often occurs when one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that their preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.\nFor decades, autism was seen as a developmental challenge that primarily affected children. Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism have cause adults to be overlooked by many people. Because so little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some existing research suggests that autistic adults face reduced life expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset of age-related cognitive concernsMason et al. (2022). Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect to aging, and most of these “lost generations” (Wright 2015) have not yet even been counted."

Key findings include Weiss (2023):\n\nThe Autism Spectrum is not Linear\nAutistic people aren’t “more” or “less” autistic so much as they are autistic in different ways.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. What the autism spectrum means.\n\n\n\nDisability can be Contextual:\nMost autistic individuals are not intellectually or physically disabled but face substantial challenges navigating society. Navigating society feels like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best.\nMisconceptions:\nScience has refuted many harmful misconceptions about autism. Some autistic people have different accompanying conditions that can result in problems with body awareness, identifying their emotional state, or using speech. However, autistic people do not intrinsically lack feelings, empathy, social skills, or the ability to communicate.\nLifelong Condition:\nAutism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured. There are roughly the same percentage of autistic adults as children, but there are four times as many adults as children.\nNeurodiversity & Neurodivergence:\nThe neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Individual people with cognitive styles that are significantly atypical are neurodivergent, and many have unmet needs."

    "text": "Lost Generations of Autistic Adults\nAutistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often face a lack of access to appropriate healthcare and support services.\nAutistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While they rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved. Most autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn’t being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in the workplace.\nAutistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Key issues include:\n\nFocus Gaps: Research and services have predominantly focused on children leaving out adults, especially those without profound disabilities. We have failed, and continue to fail, to adequately study autistic life after high school when children lose many supports.\n\nDespite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table.\n\n\n\n\nASAN, About Autism. 2009. “About Autism - Autistic Self Advocacy Network.” https://autisticadvocacy.org/.

At the end of the Sprout phase, we will report to our umbrella organizations and all funders/sponsors.\nWe are on the verge of launching a GoFundMe crowdsource campaign, a crucial step that hinges on our nonprofit status being confirmed by ARRO. The urgency is palpable as we aim to raise a substantial seed fund of $2k-$3k per week, a total of $34k, to kickstart our formal operations. This will pave the way for our 8-week Sprout phase, which we plan to initiate within our first month.\nOur initial 8 weeks of formal operation, known as the Sprout phase, are meticulously planned. We will create a comprehensive calendar of funding deadlines and proactively communicate with funders to prioritize our grant-writing efforts. Equally important is the completion of our initial projects during this phase, which will serve as tangible proof of our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the end of the Sprout phase, we will provide a detailed report to our umbrella organizations and all funders/sponsors.\nWe have already identified almost 100 grants and sponsorships (see Appendix D) for which we meet the basic requirements. These include grants from the State of Oregon (e.g. Oregon Health Authority), Oregon healthcare companies (Legacy, Pacific Source, Cambia, etc.), and a mixture of private and public foundations and trusts. We have missed the 2024 funding cycle for some of these, but many have multiple cycles per year or do not run in cycles. Some of these are small pots of money, and others regularly award hundreds of thousands of dollars. We will also collect sliding-scale fees for using The Uncommons co-working spaces.\nDuring our Grow phase, we hope to show that we can collect, analyze, and disseminate information for and about the adult autistic community with a very high level of capacity and efficiency. We hope this expertise will enable us to secure outside contracts as subject matter experts, analysts, and report writers, providing another avenue for revenue. We will complete the Grow phase with a report to our umbrella organization and our financial supporters."

This coupled with the possibility of reduced social support all increase our risk of exposure to homelessness. The few studies that attempted to investigate autism in homeless populations suggest that rates of autism in homeless populations is much higher than that observed in the general public, and may be ten times higher (Churchard et al. 2019). Autistic people additionally face extra barriers in accessing the few services for unhoused people. Environments created with the intention of providing support may be aversive or even harmful for autistic people (Kargas et al. 2019)."

When researchers took into account psychiatric conditions that increase suicide risk, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, autistic people still had a higher risk than the comparison group [@|autism2022]. The International Society for Autism Research says “Suicide in autism is a hidden crisis, overlooked by policymakers, clinicians and researchers worldwide.” and highlights three barriers: a lack of evidence-based assessment tools and interventions to identify and treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors; a lack of access to mental health services10 and exclusion from conversations about policies and guidelines that affect autistic people.” (Cassidy et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\nAngell, Amber M., Allison Empey, and Katharine E.

    "text": "ADLs\n\nWhen a person applies for Medicaid long-term care services in Oregon, we look at how much help they need to perform Activities of Daily Living. Because funding is limited, we use this information (called a service priority level) to decide who is eligible for services. Activities of Daily Living are the basic personal activities all of us need to do that are essential for health and safety. These activities are defined in OAR 411-015-0006 [https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-services/pages/adl.aspx](https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-services/pages/adl.aspx)\n\nAlexithymia\n\nAlexithymia is the inability for someone to recognize, identify, and describe feelings or emotions. It is sometimes referred to as emotional blindness. [https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963](https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963)\n\nAsperger’s Syndrome\n\nAsperger’s syndrome (sometimes called high-functioning autism) is part of a wide diagnosis called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since 2013, Asperger’s syndrome is replaced by the broader diagnosis of ASD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) revised criteria. [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436-asperger-syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436-asperger-syndrome)\n\nCo-Occurring Conditions\n\nThe preferred term in the autistic community as a replacement for “comorbid” for conditions, traits, and behaviors that are commonly found along with autism.\n\nDouble Empathy\n\nDouble empathy refers to how: 1. It is easier to understand the mindset of people who are similar to you 2. It is more difficult to understand the mindset of those who are different from you This concept was specifically developed by the autistic autism researcher Damian Milton to explain how autistics and neurotypicals empathize with each other. It explains how allistics (non-autistics) struggle to understand the lived experiences of autistics and autistics struggle to understand the lived experiences of allistics. Likewise, autistics are better at understanding other autistics and allistics are better at understanding other allistics. [404 Not Found | Embrace Autism](https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-the-double-empathy-problem/)\n\nDyslexia\n\nDyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which primarily affects reading and writing skills. However, it does not only affect these skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills. It is important to remember that there are positives to thinking differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as reasoning and in visual and creative fields. [https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia)\n\nDyspraxia\n\nDyspraxia is a term that refers to lifelong trouble with movement and coordination. It’s not a formal diagnosis. But you may still hear people use this term, especially in the U.K. The formal diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder (DCD). [https://www.understood.org/en/articles/understanding-dyspraxia](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/understanding-dyspraxia)\n\nfMRI\n\nFunctional MRI is a type of MRI scan that can show which areas of your brain are most active. Tracking and comparing that activity to what you were doing at the time can help “map” your brain activity. It’s most often used for planning surgery or similar procedures in the brain. [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri)\n\nGender identity\n\nOne’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One’s gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth. [https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions](https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions)\n\nGenome\n\nThe genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the cell’s nucleus, as well as a small chromosome in the cell’s mitochondria. A genome contains all the information needed for an individual to develop and function.

[https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance/Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance/Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf)\n\nNeurodivergent\n\nSee Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence\n\nNeurodiversity\n\nSee Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence\n\nNon-Speaking\n\nWhen an autistic person doesn’t speak, it’s known as nonspeaking autism. You may also see it described as nonverbal autism. However, the term nonverbal isn’t completely accurate, since it means “without words. Even if an autistic person is nonspeaking, they may still use words in other ways (such as in writing). They may also understand the words that are spoken to them or that they overhear. [https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism](https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism)\n\nOCD\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning, checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. [Psychiatry.org](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder)\n\nODDS\n\nOregon Office of Developmental Disabilities Services\n\nOHP\n\nOregon Health Plan: Oregon Medicaid\n\nServices Cliff\n\nMany high school students on the autism spectrum get help through special education – most commonly including speech-language therapy, service coordination/case management, behavior management, and special transportation. Each student has a team that works with the student and family to decide which services are needed to prepare him or her for young adulthood, and federal law requires schools to offer the necessary services. Sounds like a good plan for how to help vulnerable youth through a challenging period of life. But then, following the last day of high school, the legal mandate for help suddenly ends. [https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/](https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/)\n\nSexual orientation\n\nAn inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people. Note: an individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender identity. [https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions](https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions)\n\nSynesthesia\n\nSynesthesia is when your brain routes sensory information through multiple unrelated senses, causing you to experience more than one sense simultaneously. Some examples include tasting words or linking colors to numbers and letters. It’s not a medical condition, and many people find it useful to help them learn and remember information. [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia)\n\nTheory of Mind\n\nIn psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others’ beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts may be different from one’s own. Possessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others’ behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person’s capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical with having the capacity for empathy or sympathy. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind)"

    "text": "Neurodiversity (concept)\nDefinition: Neurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and others, are natural variations of the human genome. This concept emphasizes that these differences should be recognized and respected as a part of human diversity.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurodiversity” was coined in the late 1990s by sociologist Judy Singer. It arose from the disability rights movement and the autistic rights movement, which sought to challenge the medical model of disability that views neurological differences as deficits or disorders to be cured. Instead, neurodiversity advocates promote acceptance and understanding, emphasizing the strengths and contributions of neurodivergent individuals."

    "text": "Neurodiversity (paradigm)\nDefinition: The neurodiversity paradigm is a framework that challenges traditional views of neurological differences. It posits that these differences should be seen as normal variations rather than abnormalities or deficits. This paradigm promotes the idea that society should adapt to accommodate these differences rather than forcing individuals to conform to a neurotypical standard.\nHistorical and Social Context: This paradigm shift gained momentum in the early 2000s, aligning with broader social movements advocating for civil rights and inclusion. It has influenced fields like education, employment, and healthcare, encouraging practices that support diverse ways of thinking and learning."

    "text": "Neurodiversity (movement)\nDefinition: The neurodiversity movement is a social movement that advocates for the rights and inclusion of neurodivergent individuals. It seeks to promote understanding, acceptance, and accommodation of neurological differences. The movement has worked to reframe autism as a minority identity rather than a disorder.\nHistorical and Social Context: Emerging in the late 20th century, the neurodiversity movement has been driven by self-advocates and allies. It challenges stigmatizing narratives and calls for systemic changes in how neurodivergent individuals are treated in society. This movement has led to increased visibility and advocacy for policies that support neurodiversity in schools, workplaces, and communities."

    "text": "Neurodivergence\nDefinition: Neurodivergence refers to the state of having a brain that functions differently from the typical standards of society. It is an umbrella term that includes various neurological conditions like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurodivergence” gained prominence alongside the neurodiversity movement. It helps to create a more inclusive language that recognizes the spectrum of neurological differences without implying pathology. This shift in terminology supports a more positive and accepting view of diverse cognitive profiles."

This term is used to identify people who have conditions like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.\nHistorical and Social Context: The adoption of the term “neurodivergent” reflects a growing acceptance of diversity in neurological functioning. It emphasizes identity and self-advocacy, allowing individuals to claim their differences as part of who they are rather than as something to be fixed or hidden."

    "text": "Neurotypical\nDefinition: Neurotypical refers to individuals whose neurological development and functioning are considered standard or typical by societal norms. It is often used in contrast to neurodivergent.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurotypical” originated within the neurodiversity community as a way to distinguish between those who conform to societal norms of neurological functioning and those who do not. It highlights that “typical” neurological functioning is not the only valid or acceptable way of being, promoting a more inclusive view of human diversity.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Singer, J. (1998).
