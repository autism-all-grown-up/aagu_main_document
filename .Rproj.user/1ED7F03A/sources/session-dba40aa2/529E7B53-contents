## The New World of Autism

Recent advancements in our understanding of autism, largely driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers, have highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in understanding and supporting autistic individuals. Key findings include [@ASAN2009,@Weiss2023]:

-   **The Autism Spectrum is not Linear**

    Autistic people aren't "more" or "less" autistic so much as they are autistic in different ways.

-   **Disability can be Contextual:**

    Most autistic individuals are not intellectually or physically disabled but face substantial challenges navigating society. Navigating society feels like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best.

-   **Misconceptions:**

    Science has refuted many harmful misconceptions about autism. Some autistic people have different accompanying conditions that can result in problems with body awareness, identifying their emotional state, or using speech. However, autistic people do not intrinsically lack feelings, empathy, social skills, or the ability to communicate.

-   **Lifelong Condition:**

    Autism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured. There are roughly the same percentage of autistic adults as children, but there are four times as many adults as children.

-   **Neurodiversity & Neurodivergence:**

    The *neurodiversity paradigm* recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Individual people with cognitive styles that are significantly atypical are *neurodivergent*, and many have unmet needs.

## Lost Generations of Autistic Adults {#sec-autism2024_lost_gen}

Autistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often face a lack of access to appropriate healthcare and support services.

Autistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While they rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved. Most autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn't being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in the workplace.

Autistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Key issues include:

-   **Focus Gaps:** Research and services have predominantly focused on children leaving out adults, especially those without profound disabilities. We have failed, and continue to fail, to adequately study autistic life after high school when children lose many supports.

Despite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table.
