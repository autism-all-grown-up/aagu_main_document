## The New World of Autism

Recent advancements in autism research, largely driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers, have highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in understanding and supporting autistic individuals. Key findings include:

  -   **Navigational Challenges:** Most autistic individuals are not intellectually disabled but face substantial challenges navigating society. Navigating society feels like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best.

-   **Lifelong Condition:** Autism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured. There are roughly the same percentage of autistic adults as children, but there are four times as many adults as children.

-   **Neurodiversity:** The neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Statistically, fewer than half of autistic people are intellectually disabled but may face challenges navigating a neurotypical world. A significant population of autistic adults has needs that are often unmet.

-   **Focus Gaps:** Research and services have predominantly focused on children and intellectually disabled adults, leaving a gap for others. We have failed, and continue to fail, to study autistic life after high school.

-   Autism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured.

-   Most autistic people are not intellectually or physically disabled but may face substantial challenges.

-   The neurodiversity paradigm recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. For many autistic people, the hardest part about being autistic is navigating a neurotypical world.

-   Research and services have predominantly focused on children leaving out adults, especially those without profound disabilities.

## Lost Generations of Autistic Adults  {#sec-autism2024_lost_gen}

Autistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often face a lack of access to appropriate healthcare and support services.

Autistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While they rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved. Most autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn't being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in the workplace.

Autistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Key issues include:

Despite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table.
