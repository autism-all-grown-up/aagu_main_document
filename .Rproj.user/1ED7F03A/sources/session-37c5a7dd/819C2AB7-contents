> What is another example of a natural human physical or motor variation such as left-handedness that we used to treat as a problem or something to correct but eventually accepted and accommodate?

One example of a natural human physical variation that was once treated as a problem but is now generally accepted is eye dominance, particularly cross-dominance or mixed-handedness.

Eye dominance refers to the tendency to prefer visual input from one eye over the other. Cross-dominance occurs when a person's dominant eye is on the opposite side of their dominant hand (e.g., left-eye dominant but right-handed). Mixed-handedness is when a person uses different hands for different tasks.

Historically:

1.  Treatment as a problem: In the past, cross-dominance and mixed-handedness were sometimes viewed as issues to be corrected, especially in educational and sports settings. It was thought to potentially cause learning difficulties or poor performance in certain activities.

2.  Attempts at correction: Some educators and coaches would try to "retrain" individuals to align their eye and hand dominance or to become more consistently right or left-handed.

3.  Misunderstanding: These traits were sometimes incorrectly associated with learning disabilities or behavioral problems.

Current understanding and accommodation:

1.  Acceptance: Today, eye dominance and mixed-handedness are recognized as natural variations in human neurology and physiology.

2.  Sports adaptation: Many sports now acknowledge the potential advantages of cross-dominance in certain positions or situations. For example, in baseball, a batter with cross-dominance might have an advantage in tracking the ball.

3.  Educational approaches: Instead of trying to "correct" these traits, educational methods now focus on working with a student's natural tendencies.

4.  Ergonomic considerations: In some fields, such as photography or microscopy, tools and techniques have been developed to accommodate various eye dominance patterns.

5.  Research focus: Studies now explore potential benefits of cross-dominance and mixed-handedness, such as improved adaptability in certain tasks.

This shift in perspective mirrors the journey of understanding and accepting left-handedness. It demonstrates how society can move from trying to "fix" natural human variations to recognizing and accommodating them as part of human diversity.

> I'm trying to think of OTHER human differences which have been stigmatized the way handedness used to be.

I apologize for misunderstanding your question. You're looking for other examples of human differences that have been stigmatized in the past, similar to left-handedness. Here are a few examples:

1.  Hair texture and color:
    -   Natural curly or kinky hair, especially in Black communities, was often stigmatized and seen as "unprofessional" or "unkempt."
    -   Red hair was sometimes associated with negative stereotypes or superstitions in various cultures.
    -   Today, there's growing acceptance and celebration of diverse hair types and colors.
2.  Freckles:
    -   Once considered blemishes to be hidden or removed, freckles are now often embraced as a unique and attractive feature.
3.  Body hair:
    -   Natural body hair, especially on women, has been stigmatized in many cultures.
    -   There's a growing movement to accept body hair as a natural variation.
4.  Height variations:
    -   Both extreme tallness and shortness have been stigmatized at times.
    -   While some stigma remains, there's increasing acceptance of height diversity.
5.  Skin color and tone:
    -   Various skin tones have been stigmatized in different cultures and times.
    -   While racism remains a significant issue, there's growing celebration of skin color diversity.
6.  Birthmarks:
    -   Once sometimes seen as signs of bad luck or imperfection, birthmarks are increasingly accepted as natural variations.
7.  Ambidexterity:
    -   Similar to left-handedness, being able to use both hands equally well was sometimes seen as unusual or problematic.
    -   Now it's often recognized as a potentially beneficial trait.
8.  Voice pitch:
    -   Particularly for men with higher-pitched voices or women with lower-pitched voices, this has been a source of stigma.
    -   There's growing acceptance of diverse voice types in professional and social settings.
9.  Facial features:
    -   Features like prominent noses, gap teeth, or unique eye shapes have been stigmatized in various cultures.
    -   There's an increasing trend to appreciate diverse facial features.

These examples show how societal perceptions of physical differences can change over time, moving from stigmatization to acceptance and even celebration of human diversity. This shift often parallels broader social changes and increased understanding of human variation.

> Those are great examples!

> While most things in the world are still designed around right-handed people, we do now make left-handed musical instruments and have made things like left-handed scissors which allow left-handed people to cut with the same comfort and accuracy as right-handed people.

> Can you think of other examples that require physical or mechanical accommodation?

You're absolutely right, and I'm glad you appreciated those examples! The accommodation of left-handedness is indeed a great model for how we can adapt our environment to suit diverse needs. Let's explore some other examples of physical or mechanical accommodations for human variations:

1.  Colorblindness:
    -   Color-coded interfaces now often include patterns or symbols in addition to colors.
    -   Some traffic lights have distinct shapes for each color to aid colorblind drivers.
    -   Video games increasingly offer colorblind modes with adjusted color palettes.
2.  Height differences:
    -   Adjustable desks and chairs in workplaces.
    -   Step stools in public spaces like libraries.
    -   Extendable handles on luggage for people of different heights.
3.  Mobility variations:
    -   Curb cuts on sidewalks, initially designed for wheelchair users, now benefit many (Universal Design principle).
    -   Adjustable car pedals and steering wheels for drivers of different heights.
    -   Automatic doors in public buildings.
4.  Sensory sensitivities:
    -   Noise-cancelling headphones for those sensitive to sound.
    -   Dimmer switches and adjustable lighting for visual sensitivities.
    -   Weighted blankets for those who benefit from deep pressure stimulation.
5.  Grip strength variations:
    -   Easy-open packaging and containers.
    -   Ergonomic tools with larger grips for those with arthritis or reduced hand strength.
6.  Reading differences:
    -   Audiobooks and text-to-speech technology for those who struggle with reading text.
    -   Dyslexia-friendly fonts in some publications and websites.
7.  Dexterity variations:
    -   Touch-sensitive or voice-activated devices for those with limited fine motor control.
    -   Adaptive gaming controllers for people with various physical abilities.
8.  Body size variations:
    -   Plus-size clothing lines and extended size ranges.
    -   Airplane seatbelt extenders and seats with adjustable widths.
9.  Neurodivergent needs:
    -   Fidget toys and sensory tools in classrooms and workplaces.
    -   Quiet rooms or spaces in public areas for those who need to decompress.
10. Visual acuity differences:
    -   Scalable fonts and high-contrast modes on digital devices.
    -   Braille signage in public spaces.
11. Temperature sensitivity:
    -   Personal desktop fans or heaters in shared workspaces.
    -   Clothing with built-in heating or cooling technology.

These examples demonstrate how design can evolve to accommodate a wide range of human variations, often benefiting many beyond the initially targeted group. This approach, known as Universal Design, aims to create environments and products that are usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.

> Those are more great examples.

Thank you, I'm glad you find these examples valuable. Your interest in this topic highlights an important aspect of designing for human diversity. It's worth noting that many of these accommodations, like those for left-handed individuals, have benefits that extend beyond their initial target group.

For instance:

1.  Curb cuts, initially designed for wheelchair users, also benefit parents with strollers, travelers with wheeled luggage, and delivery workers with hand trucks.

2.  Closed captions, originally for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers, are useful for people learning languages, watching in noisy environments, or those who process information better through text.

3.  Voice-activated controls, while crucial for some with mobility impairments, are convenient for many others, like when cooking with messy hands.

This principle of designing for the extremes but benefiting the middle is often referred to as the "curb-cut effect" in universal design.

Your examples and questions suggest a deep interest in how we can create more inclusive environments. This kind of thinking is crucial as we move towards a society that better accommodates all forms of human diversity, including neurodiversity.

Is there a particular area of accommodation or universal design that you're especially interested in or think needs more attention?
