# Autism All Grown Up (AAGU): A Nexus for Change {#sec-aagu}

## Origin {#sec-aagu_origin}

AAGU was born out of Dr. Balter's desire to use his personal experiences and analytical skills to help his newfound community. By conducting root cause analyses and working with local organizations, he identified key areas where AAGU could make an immediate impact, such as:

-   Creating accessible guides for obtaining adult autism diagnoses through Oregon's Medicaid and Vocational Rehabilitation systems
-   Establishing *The Uncommons*, autism-friendly co-working and community spaces
-   Improving online resources for autistic adults and providing consulting services to others to do the same
-   Participating in data analysis and research efforts to better understand the needs of autistic adults in Oregon

## What We Have Started {#sec-aagu_started}

AAGU has already made strides in achieving its objectives through initiatives such as:

-   Partnering with Health Share Oregon to create guides for accessing autism assessments through Medicaid and developing a template Letter of Medical Necessity to facilitate evaluations through I/DD and Vocational Rehab programs
-   Securing temporary spaces for *The Uncommons*, autism-friendly co-working and community spaces
-   Consulting with the Autism Society of Oregon to improve their online resources
-   Participating in the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder's data working group
-   Planning a State-wide conference to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*

## Goals {#sec-aagu_goals}
