# Mission {#sec-mission}

The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by serving as a nexus that provides accessible information, resources, and services tailored to their unique needs. By bridging gaps in the existing infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and their supporters, facilitate information exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic individuals can access the support and opportunities they need to thrive, enhancing their well-being and independence throughout the state. 


# Executive Summary {#sec-executive_summary}

## Background {#sec-ex_sum_background}

Dr. Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD later in life and is raising a teenager with both diagnoses. His desire to understand these challenges led him to study the scientific and social aspects of neurodiversity. Recent changes driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers have reshaped our understanding of autism, revealing significant gaps in support for autistic adults. These changes have led to controversies and arguments that are still unfolding, emphasizing the evolving nature of the understanding of autism.

Through his personal journey and interactions with the local autistic community, Dr. Balter identified significant gaps in services, support, and understanding for autistic adults without intellectual disabilities. He was struck by the level of unmet need he heard from his peersâ€”people with skills, education, and abilities but struggling for reasons related to autism. These personal experiences led Dr. Balter to found Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) to address these gaps.

## Goals {#sec-ex_sum_goals}

The organization has four key objectives:

1.  Facilitate connections and collaboration within the adult autistic community
2.  Identify the unmet needs of autistic adults and report on the causes
3.  Provide accurate, accessible, and up-to-date information and resources *for* autistic adults
4.  Provide accurate, accessible, and up-to-date information and resources *about* autism and *about* the autistic community

## Autism All Grown Up {#sec-ex_name}

Autism is all grown up, and it isn't pretty. The phrase "All Grown Up" captures the bittersweet realization that often occurs when one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that their preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.

For decades, autism was seen as a developmental challenge that primarily affected children. Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism have cause adults to be overlooked by many people. Because so little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some existing research suggests that autistic adults face reduced life expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset of age-related cognitive concerns[@Mason2021,@Mason2022]. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect to aging, and most of these "lost generations" [@Wright2015] have not yet even been counted.

## The Nexus Approach {#sec-ex_sum_nexus}

Rather than working on advocacy, Dr. Balter feels he can more directly serve the autistic community in Oregon by solving problems on the ground. Systemic and societal problems can only be addressed through advocacy. But many of the real-world problems faced by supporting existing infrastructure by increasing the connectivity and information flow. Rather than being a hub that consumes resources and provides services, AAGU will catalyze and strengthen relationships around it to form a *nexus*. 


# Autism in 2024 {#sec-autism2024}

## The New World of Autism

Recent advancements in our understanding of autism, largely driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers, have highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in understanding and supporting autistic individuals. Key findings include [@ASAN2009,@Weiss2023]:

-   **The Autism Spectrum is not Linear**

    Autistic people aren't "more" or "less" autistic so much as they are autistic in different ways.

![Figure 1. What the autism spectrum means.](media/autism_spectrum.jpeg){#img-autism_spectrum fig-alt="Picture of radar chart vs linear spectrum to illustrate autism." fig-align="center" width="50%"}

-   **Disability can be Contextual:**

    Most autistic individuals are not intellectually or physically disabled but face substantial challenges navigating society. Navigating society feels like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best.

-   **Misconceptions:**

    Science has refuted many harmful misconceptions about autism. Some autistic people have different accompanying conditions that can result in problems with body awareness, identifying their emotional state, or using speech. However, autistic people do not intrinsically lack feelings, empathy, social skills, or the ability to communicate.

-   **Lifelong Condition:**

    Autism is a lifelong neurological difference, not a disorder to be cured. There are roughly the same percentage of autistic adults as children, but there are four times as many adults as children.

-   **Neurodiversity & Neurodivergence:**

    The *neurodiversity paradigm* recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Individual people with cognitive styles that are significantly atypical are *neurodivergent*, and many have unmet needs.

## Lost Generations of Autistic Adults {#sec-autism2024_lost_gen}

Autistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often face a lack of access to appropriate healthcare and support services.

Autistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While they rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved. Most autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn't being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in the workplace.

Autistic adults face unique challenges that are often overlooked, such as navigating social and employment environments not designed for neurodivergent individuals. Key issues include:

-   **Focus Gaps:** Research and services have predominantly focused on children leaving out adults, especially those without profound disabilities. We have failed, and continue to fail, to adequately study autistic life after high school when children lose many supports.

Despite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table. 


# Autism All Grown Up (AAGU): A Nexus for Change {#sec-aagu}

## Origin {#sec-aagu_origin}

AAGU was born out of Dr. Balter's desire to use his personal experiences and analytical skills to help his newfound community. By conducting root cause analyses and working with local organizations, he identified key areas where AAGU could make an immediate impact, such as:

-   Creating accessible guides for obtaining adult autism diagnoses through Oregon's Medicaid and Vocational Rehabilitation systems
-   Establishing *The Uncommons*, autism-friendly co-working and community spaces
-   Improving online resources for autistic adults and providing consulting services to others to do the same
-   Participating in data analysis and research efforts to better understand the needs of autistic adults in Oregon

## What We Have Started {#sec-aagu_started}

AAGU has already made strides in achieving its objectives through initiatives such as:

-   Partnering with Health Share Oregon to create guides for accessing autism assessments through Medicaid and developing a template Letter of Medical Necessity to facilitate evaluations through I/DD and Vocational Rehab programs
-   Securing temporary spaces for *The Uncommons*, autism-friendly co-working and community spaces
-   Consulting with the Autism Society of Oregon to improve their online resources
-   Participating in the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder's data working group
-   Planning a State-wide conference to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*

## Goals {#sec-aagu_goals}

Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) seeks to activate and empower the autistic community in Oregon by improving communication channels and information resources. Our immediate actions include:

-   Establishing *The Uncommons*, a meeting and coworking space for autistic adults
-   Creating comprehensive guides on navigating healthcare, employment, and social services
-   Building partnerships with local organizations to enhance service delivery
-   Participating in data analysis and research to inform policy and advocacy efforts

Our growth plan consists of three phases:

1.  Seed (Weeks 1-8): Set up organizational structure, solicit initial funds, establish community presence, and build initial partnerships
2.  Sprout (Weeks 9-26): Continue building community connections, develop *The Uncommons*, create informational materials, and identify large funding opportunities
3.  Grow (Beyond Week 26): Expand *The Uncommons*, apply for large grants, build information and communication infrastructure, and establish a sustainable model for ongoing operations

Through a phased growth plan, AAGU will continue to expand its reach and impact, with a strong emphasis on hiring autistic individuals and providing them with meaningful employment opportunities. By leveraging the strengths and talents of the autistic community, AAGU is uniquely positioned to create lasting, positive change for autistic adults in Oregon. \# Funding {#funding}

We are poised to launch a GoFundMe crowdsource campaign as soon as we have our nonprofit status confirmed by ARRO. We hope to raise seed money of \$2k-\$3k per week to jump start formal operations \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* next \$34k for our 8-week Sprout phase. We hope to launch the Sprout phase within our first month.

A key element of our first 8 weeks of formal operation (Sprout) will be to create a calendar of funding deadlines and communicate with funders to prioritize our initial grant-writing efforts. It will also be crucial that we complete the initial projects we have started during the Sprout phase to demonstrate our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the end of the Sprout phase, we will report to our umbrella organizations and all funders/sponsors.

We are on the verge of launching a GoFundMe crowdsource campaign, a crucial step that hinges on our nonprofit status being confirmed by ARRO. The urgency is palpable as we aim to raise a substantial seed fund of \$2k-\$3k per week, a total of \$34k, to kickstart our formal operations. This will pave the way for our 8-week Sprout phase, which we plan to initiate within our first month.

Our initial 8 weeks of formal operation, known as the Sprout phase, are meticulously planned. We will create a comprehensive calendar of funding deadlines and proactively communicate with funders to prioritize our grant-writing efforts. Equally important is the completion of our initial projects during this phase, which will serve as tangible proof of our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the end of the Sprout phase, we will provide a detailed report to our umbrella organizations and all funders/sponsors.

We have already identified almost 100 grants and sponsorships (see @sec-potential-funders) for which we meet the basic requirements. These include grants from the State of Oregon (e.g. Oregon Health Authority), Oregon healthcare companies (Legacy, Pacific Source, Cambia, etc.), and a mixture of private and public foundations and trusts. We have missed the 2024 funding cycle for some of these, but many have multiple cycles per year or do not run in cycles. Some of these are small pots of money, and others regularly award hundreds of thousands of dollars. We will also collect sliding-scale fees for using *The Uncommons* co-working spaces.

During our Grow phase, we hope to show that we can collect, analyze, and disseminate information for and about the adult autistic community with a very high level of capacity and efficiency. We hope this expertise will enable us to secure outside contracts as subject matter experts, analysts, and report writers, providing another avenue for revenue. We will complete the Grow phase with a report to our umbrella organization and our financial supporters. 31b8e172-b470-440e-83d8-e6b185028602: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:31b8e172-b470-440e-83d8-e6b185028602

Autism All Grown Up will place a strong emphasis on hiring autistic and neurodiverse Oregon adults and paying them a market wage. The wages will be at the low end during the initial Seed and Sprout phases and increase during the later phases. The hourly rates shown represent full compensation on a 1099 and do not include benefits. We will make necessary adjustments when we are able to provide benefits as well.

We have created our budget estimate based on the minimum staffing we believe can meet our performance goals combined with market-rate salary estimates from \[ZipRecruiter\] (https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries) for approximate job titles in the Portland, OR area (see @sec-representative-salaries). We project a budget of approximately \$150,000 for the first six months (26 weeks) of operation.

# Special Issues and Concerns

## The Services Cliff {#sec-services_cliff}

-   Services Cliff: Young autistic adults also face significant challenges transitioning out of high school, often referred to as the "services cliff." This sudden drop-off in support can lead to difficulties in finding meaningful work, pursuing higher education, and living independently. \[<https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/>\].

Transition to Adulthood This problem does not just affect existing adults. The sudden drop-off of support upon graduating high school has become known as the services cliff. One of the biggest worries faced by both parents of autistic people and young autistic people themselves is what will happen after they graduate from high school. Will they be offered meaningful work in tolerant and respectful environments? Will they be able to earn enough to live independently? Will they find open doors in trade schools or collegFes and be offered the support they might need?

## Access to Medical Care {#sec-access_to_care}

There is an immense amount of work to do to help prepare the aging autistic adult community and a poorly informed medical system to successfully face these challenges right now and in the coming decades. Fortunately, there are also many skilled, intelligent, creative, compassionate, and hard-working people in the autistic community who are ready and capable of doing this work. And they are the right people to do it.

## Medical Training {#sec-training_for_providers}

Lack of training for healthcare providers

## Autism Research Funding Priorities {#sec-research_funding_providers}

Despite the fact that advocates and researchers have been pushing for decades to have autism research funding focus more on quality of life and less on "prevention and cure", the trend has only gotten worse.

![Figure 2. Data from \[Interagency Autism Coordination Committee\](https://iacc.hhs.gov/funding/data/)](./media/image1.png){#img-autism_research_funding fig-alt="Graph of funding for autism research years 2010 to 2020 by category showing that very little research goes to quality of life issues vs. biology (prevention and cure)." width="5.481101268591426in"}

## Intersectionally Marginalized Groups {#sec-marginalized}

All of these problems compound for members of intersectional populations who may already be marginalized along other dimensions. Many researchers believe that autism is [@Fombonne2022], particularly in Black communities [@Angell2018], as well as for [@DMello2022]. Meanwhile, fluidity in gender and sexual orientation [@George2018a, @George2018] is more highly represented among autistic people. Little research has been done to assess how autism uniquely affects people in these different subgroups.

## Physical and Mental Health {#sec-physical_mental_health}

-   Health and Well-being: Autistic adults experience higher rates of mental health issues, physical health disparities, and substantially elevated suicide risk \[<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00463-7>, <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33407027/>\].
-   Social Isolation: Negative social experiences can lead to self-isolation, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and exclusion [@Loomes2017]

Across a variety of health domains, autistic people fare worse [@LodiSmith2021, @LodiSmith2021a]. Additionally, we are exposed to risks that are not of primary concern for most people [@Muskens2017]. These include autoimmune dysregulation of many kinds, autonomic dysregulation, connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and many other areas of health concerns. A lack of understanding regarding these differences, coupled with communication barriers and false notions about autism all collude to create barriers to accessing health services and care.

## Unemployment {#sec-unemployment}

-   Employment: Many autistic adults face difficulties finding and maintaining employment due to biases and lack of accommodations. In a study of 254 autistic adults, 77% reported difficulties applying for jobs, and only 16% are in full-time paid work \[<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215190/>, <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.719827/full>\].

## Homelessness {#sec-homelessness}

Barriers to entry to the workplace as well as challenges and holding jobs due to ablest attitudes or inflexible policies put us at risk of severe financial strain [@Ohl2017]. This coupled with the possibility of reduced social support all increase our risk of exposure to homelessness. The few studies that attempted to investigate autism in homeless populations suggest that rates of autism in homeless populations is much higher than that observed in the general public, and may be ten times higher [@Churchard2019]. Autistic people additionally face extra barriers in accessing the few services for unhoused people. Environments created with the intention of providing support may be aversive or even harmful for autistic people [@Kargas2019].

## Suicide {#sec-suicide}

As a group, their suicide risk may be two to seven times higher than the risk for youth and adults who do not have autism. When researchers took into account psychiatric conditions that increase suicide risk, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, autistic people still had a higher risk than the comparison group \[\@\|autism2022\]. The International Society for Autism Research says "Suicide in autism is a hidden crisis, overlooked by policymakers, clinicians and researchers worldwide." and highlights three barriers: a lack of evidence-based assessment tools and interventions to identify and treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors; a lack of access to mental health services10 and exclusion from conversations about policies and guidelines that affect autistic people."

# Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence {#sec-neurodiversity}

Many people find [[this article]{.underline}](https://neuroqueer.com/neurodiversity-terms-and-definitions/) by Dr. Nick Walker to be the definitive overview of these terms and how they are used and misused. We put together the summary below with the help of [[chatGPT]{.underline}](https://chatgpt.com/share/e60ffdec-5945-45d2-9a14-2abe39cf4f8d):

## Neurodiversity (concept)

**Definition:** Neurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and others, are natural variations of the human genome. This concept emphasizes that these differences should be recognized and respected as a part of human diversity.

**Historical and Social Context:** The term "neurodiversity" was coined in the late 1990s by sociologist Judy Singer. It arose from the disability rights movement and the autistic rights movement, which sought to challenge the medical model of disability that views neurological differences as deficits or disorders to be cured. Instead, neurodiversity advocates promote acceptance and understanding, emphasizing the strengths and contributions of neurodivergent individuals.

## Neurodiversity (paradigm)

**Definition:** The neurodiversity paradigm is a framework that challenges traditional views of neurological differences. It posits that these differences should be seen as normal variations rather than abnormalities or deficits. This paradigm promotes the idea that society should adapt to accommodate these differences rather than forcing individuals to conform to a neurotypical standard.

**Historical and Social Context:** This paradigm shift gained momentum in the early 2000s, aligning with broader social movements advocating for civil rights and inclusion. It has influenced fields like education, employment, and healthcare, encouraging practices that support diverse ways of thinking and learning.

## Neurodiversity (movement)

**Definition:** The neurodiversity movement is a social movement that advocates for the rights and inclusion of neurodivergent individuals. It seeks to promote understanding, acceptance, and accommodation of neurological differences. The movement has worked to reframe autism as a minority identity rather than a disorder.

**Historical and Social Context:** Emerging in the late 20th century, the neurodiversity movement has been driven by self-advocates and allies. It challenges stigmatizing narratives and calls for systemic changes in how neurodivergent individuals are treated in society. This movement has led to increased visibility and advocacy for policies that support neurodiversity in schools, workplaces, and communities.

## Neurodivergence

**Definition:** Neurodivergence refers to the state of having a brain that functions differently from the typical standards of society. It is an umbrella term that includes various neurological conditions like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more.

**Historical and Social Context:** The term "neurodivergence" gained prominence alongside the neurodiversity movement. It helps to create a more inclusive language that recognizes the spectrum of neurological differences without implying pathology. This shift in terminology supports a more positive and accepting view of diverse cognitive profiles.

## Neurodivergent

**Definition:** Neurodivergent describes individuals whose neurological development and functioning are atypical. This term is used to identify people who have conditions like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.

**Historical and Social Context:** The adoption of the term "neurodivergent" reflects a growing acceptance of diversity in neurological functioning. It emphasizes identity and self-advocacy, allowing individuals to claim their differences as part of who they are rather than as something to be fixed or hidden.

## Neurotypical

**Definition:** Neurotypical refers to individuals whose neurological development and functioning are considered standard or typical by societal norms. It is often used in contrast to neurodivergent.

**Historical and Social Context:** The term "neurotypical" originated within the neurodiversity community as a way to distinguish between those who conform to societal norms of neurological functioning and those who do not. It highlights that "typical" neurological functioning is not the only valid or acceptable way of being, promoting a more inclusive view of human diversity.
