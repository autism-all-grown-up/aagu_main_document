            "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently identified in children but is often unrecognised in adults. ASD is characterised by difficulties in social interaction, communication and restricted interests, but other presentations are common, especially in adults. This report describes a 34-year-old man with a history of multiple psychiatric diagnoses including generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and panic disorder. He was diagnosed with ASD in his early 30s and engaged in a targeted treatment plan, including rationalisation of medications, supportive therapy and occupational therapy, which successfully facilitated discharge from mental health services. This case illustrates the atypical presentation of ASD in adults, which is diagnostically challenging. Such cases often present to community mental health services and may be misdiagnosed as treatment resistant cases of depressive, anxiety or personality disorders. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management is more likely to yield a successful outcome.",

Compared to White children, children from racial and ethnic minority groups are less likely to be diagnosed with ASD and more likely to be mis-diagnosed or diagnosed later; and once diagnosed, they receive fewer ASD services. In this article, we review current knowledge about ASD disparities, including the complex and multifaceted causes. We highlight areas where further research is needed. Finally, we review promising practices to address ASD disparities, arguing that efforts to reduce disparities are needed at multiple levels such as parent education, widespread adoption of screening in healthcare and community settings, and effective interventions developed for community and school settings.",

In Study 1 we explored quality of life and autistic trait levels in 420 autistic and TD adults, and in Study 2 we explored the experiences of 8 autistic adults diagnosed as adults. We found that autistic adults had lower quality of life outcomes and higher autistic trait levels which related to age of diagnosis, and qualitative findings indicated that while adults were empowered by their new diagnosis, they still require specialized supports. Our findings are discussed, emphasizing future directions and implications for the current care system in place for autistic adults.",

            "abstract": "Background: Over the last several decades, the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has continued to increase, creating a unique challenge for general physicians who are likely to encounter these patients in their practice. The primary aim of this cross-sectional study design was to identify potential knowledge gaps that were present among medical students and pediatric trainees (interns, residents, and fellows) particularly during the management of a sick child with ASD. Methods: A 23-question online survey was developed and distributed to medical students and pediatric trainees at a tertiary children’s hospital affiliated with a medical school. Results: Medical students and pediatric trainees reported a low general knowledge of ASD and were unfamiliar with sensory issues that is often present in these children. Increased discomfort and insufficient didactic and clinical training for providing care to children with ASD during an acute illness were also identified. Both medical students and trainees reported the need for increased education and training, preferentially via patient interaction and small group-based learning. We found that as education/training levels increased, participants perceived increased comfort and knowledge in managing an ill child with ASD. Conclusions: A perceived knowledge gap and discomfort is present amongst medical students and pediatric trainees on the management of children with ASD. Across all education levels, awareness for sensory dysregulation in ASD children is low. Education programs using direct patient interaction and small group learning were the preferred training modalities to learn how to provide optimal care for children with ASD.",

            "abstract": "Previous research shows that autistic people have high levels of co-occurring mental health conditions. Yet, a number of case reports have revealed that mental health conditions are often misdiagnosed in autistic individuals. A total of 420 adults who identified as autistic, possibly autistic or non-autistic completed an online survey consisting of questions regarding mental health diagnoses they received, whether they agreed with those diagnoses and if not why. Autistic and possibly autistic participants were more likely to report receiving mental health diagnoses compared to non-autistic participants, but were less likely to agree with those diagnoses. Thematic analysis revealed the participants’ main reasons for disagreement were that (1) they felt their autism characteristics were being confused with mental health conditions by healthcare professionals and (2) they perceived their own mental health difficulties to be resultant of ASC. Participants attributed these to the clinical barriers they experienced, including healthcare professionals’ lack of autism awareness and lack of communication, which in turn prevented them from receiving appropriate support. This study highlights the need for autism awareness training for healthcare professionals and the need to develop tools and interventions to accurately diagnose and effectively treat mental health conditions in autistic individuals.",

            "abstract": "<p>Perception of disability is an important construct affecting not only the well-being of individuals with disabilities, but also the moral compass of the society. Negative attitudes toward disability disempower individuals with disabilities and lead to their social exclusion and isolation. By contrast, a healthy society encourages positive attitudes toward individuals with disabilities and promotes social inclusion. The current review explored disability perception in the light of the in-group vs. out-group dichotomy, since individuals with disabilities may be perceived as a special case of out-group. We implemented a developmental approach to study perception of disability from early age into adolescence while exploring cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of children’s attitudes. Potential factors influencing perception of disability were considered at the level of society, family and school environment, and the individual. Better understanding of factors influencing the development of disability perception would allow the design of effective interventions to improve children’s attitudes toward peers with disabilities, reduce intergroup biases, and promote social inclusion. Based on previous research in social and developmental psychology, education, and anthropology, we proposed an integrative model that provides a conceptual framework for understanding the development of disability perception.</p>",

            "abstract": "We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a “theory of mind”. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a “theory”. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner’s puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down’s syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.",

This study describes the physical and mental health of a unique sample of all middle aged and older Wisconsin Medicaid beneficiaries with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and tests differences between those with and without co-occurring intellectual disability. Method Using de-identified Medicaid claims data for 143 adults with a recorded autism spectrum disorder diagnosis aged 40–88 years with any Wisconsin Medicaid claims in 2012 through 2015, we extracted diagnoses for physical and mental health conditions from fee-for-service claims. Logistic regression analyses—controlling for sex, race, and age—compared the adjusted odds of physical and mental health conditions for those with and without intellectual disability. Results Many physical and mental health conditions, including immune conditions (70.6%), cardiovascular disease (49.0%) and its risk factors (46.2%), sleep disorders (85.3%), gastrointestinal disorders (49.7%), neurologic conditions (55.9%), and psychiatric disorders (72.0%) were highly prevalent in our full sample. Although there were many similarities between those individuals with and without co-occurring intellectual disability, middle aged and older adults on the autism spectrum had higher prevalence of epilepsy and lower prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to those without co-occurring intellectual disability. Conclusions Findings suggest that people on the autism spectrum have a high prevalence of physical and mental health conditions in midlife and old age, regardless of intellectual disability status.",

            "abstract": "Research into autism and mental health has traditionally associated poor mental health and autism as inevitably linked. Other possible explanations for mental health problems among autistic populations have received little attention. As evidenced by the minority disability movement, autism is increasingly being considered part of the identities of autistic people. Autistic individuals thus constitute an identity-based minority and may be exposed to excess social stress as a result of disadvantaged and stigmatized social status. The authors test the utility of the minority stress model as an explanation for the experience of mental health problems within a sample of high-functioning autistic individuals (n = 111). Minority stressors including everyday discrimination, internalized stigma, and concealment significantly predicted poorer mental health, despite controlling for general stress exposure. These results indicate the potential utility of minority stress in explaining increased mental health problems in autistic populations. Implications for research and clinical applications are discussed.",

We used content analysis to categorize narratives used by autism researchers and cues for ableism (dehumanization, objectification, and stigmatization). We then used binary-logistic regression to identify whether narrative or higher inclusion of autistic people predicted fewer ableist cues, controlling for career length and connections to autistic people.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Using medicalized narratives of autism predicted higher odds of ableist cues compared to employing social model or neutral embodiment narratives. Greater inclusion of autistic people in research predicted significantly lower odds of ableist cues, while controlling for other contact with autistic people and career length. Next, we used reflexive thematic analysis to analyze researcher’s perceptions of autistic people and autism research. Narratives reflected core ideological disagreements of the field, such as whether researchers consider autism to be an intrinsic barrier to a good life, and whether researchers prioritize research which tackles “autism” versus barriers to societal inclusion for autistic people. Instrumentality (a form of objectification) was key to whether researchers considered a person to have social value with emphasis revolving around intellectual ability and independence. Lastly, language seemed to act as a tool of normalization of violence. Researchers relied on an amorphous idea of “autism” when talking about prevention or eradication, potentially because it sounds more palatable than talking about preventing “autistic people,” despite autism only existing within the context of autistic people.</p></sec>",

            "abstract": "Objectives To investigate autistic people’s views on the importance and availability of adjustments to mental and physical healthcare provision. To explore whether specific categories of adjustments can be identified and to identify any differences in their importance and availability between mental and physical healthcare. Design Data from two studies, both employing a cross-sectional survey design. Setting UK-based autistic adults registered with the Adult Autism Spectrum Cohort-UK were contacted by post or online. In both studies, recruitment was staged over a 12-month period. Non-responders were sent a single reminder letter 2 weeks after initial contact. Participants 537 autistic adults completed a survey about mental health services (51% response rate), 407 completed the physical health survey (49% response rate). Within these samples, 221 participants completed both surveys. Primary outcome measures Each study developed a bespoke survey to explore participants’ views on mental and physical health services, respectively. Both included an identical list of adjustments that participants rated based on importance and availability. Results Three factors of important adjustments were identified: sensory environment, clinical and service context, and clinician knowledge and communication. Adjustments across healthcare settings were widely rated as being important yet rarely available. One significant difference between the importance of adjustments available through mental and physical health services was identified. Participants reported that having access to a clinician who is willing to adapt their approach to suit the person’s preferences was significantly more important for participants attending mental health settings (p=0.001). Conclusions Autistic people reported the limited availability of important adjustments in current healthcare provision. To address unmet need and tackle the health inequalities faced by autistic people attending physical and mental healthcare settings, healthcare providers should offer adjustments relating to the three identified factors. Future research should focus on identifying and addressing service provider barriers to implementation.",

            "abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by impairments in the cognitive processes and in the tasks of daily life. It encompasses a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders often associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Social and communication abilities are strongly compromised in ASD. The prevalence of ID/ASD is 1–3%, and approximately 30% of the patients remain without a molecular diagnosis. Considering the extreme genetic locus heterogeneity, next-generation sequencing approaches have provided powerful tools for candidate gene identification. Molecular diagnosis is crucial to improve outcome, prevent complications, and hopefully start a therapeutic approach. Here, we performed parent–offspring trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 60 mostly syndromic ID/ASD patients and we detected 8 pathogenic variants in genes already known to be associated with ID/ASD (SYNGAP1, SMAD6, PACS1, SHANK3, KMT2A, KCNQ2, ACTB, and POGZ). We found four de novo disruptive variants of four novel candidate ASD/ID genes: MBP, PCDHA1, PCDH15, PDPR. We additionally selected via bioinformatic tools many variants in unknown genes that alone or in combination can contribute to the phenotype. In conclusion, our data confirm the efficacy of WES in detecting pathogenic variants of known and novel ID/ASD genes.",

However, no studies have explored autistic peoples’ experiences of treatment and support for these difficulties. In partnership with a steering group of autistic adults, an online survey was developed to explore these individuals’ experiences of treatment and support for mental health problems, self-injury and suicidality for the first time. A total of 200 autistic adults (122 females, 77 males and 1 unreported) aged 18–67 (mean = 38.9 years, standard deviation = 11.5), without co-occurring intellectual disability, completed the online survey. Thematic analysis of open-ended questions resulted in an overarching theme that individually tailored treatment and support was both beneficial and desirable, which consisted of three underlying themes: (1) difficulties in accessing treatment and support; (2) lack of understanding and knowledge of autistic people with co-occurring mental health difficulties and (3) appropriate treatment and support, or lack of, impacted autistic people’s well-being and likelihood of seeing suicide as their future. Findings demonstrate an urgent need for autism treatment pathways in mental health services.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, priorities for research, public policy and practice have not been decided by autistic people and those who support them. This has resulted in a lack of research relevant to the day to day lives of autistic people. To address this, INSAR’s 2021 policy brief aimed to identify the top 10 priorities to prevent suicide in partnership with autistic people and their allies. First, seven international workshops involving autistic, researcher, charity and service provider perspectives, discussed and identified 48 priorities to prevent suicide in autism. Second, an online survey, with equal weighted representation of autistic people and those who support them, prioritised and refined this longer list of priorities into the top 20 for discussion at a 2-day meeting. Third, the INSAR policy brief meeting brought together equal representation of autistic people and those who, support them to identify the top 10 research priorities, and implications for policy and practice, to prevent suicide in autistic people. This policy brief presents the autism community top 10 research priorities, and community recommendations for public policy and practice to prevent suicide in autistic people. Research which positively affects the lives of autistic people can only be achieved in close partnership between autistic people and their allies. It is important that we learn from examples of participatory working, such as this INSAR policy brief, to ensure that autistic people have a strong voice in the direction of future international research, public policy and practice. This will help ensure that autism research, policy initiatives, services, support and treatment are useful to autistic people.",

            "abstract": "Typically, although it’s notoriously hard to define, autism has been represented as a biologically-based mental disorder that can be usefully investigated by biomedical science. In recent years, however, problematic findings regarding the biological underpinnings of autism; historical research examining the shifting nature of the categorization; and a lack of biomedical utility have led some to suggest abandoning the concept of autism. My interest here is the possibility that autism may remain a meaningful and helpful classification even if it lacks scientific validity and biomedical utility. After arguing that accounts of autism as a psychiatric classification are unsustainable, I draw on feminist philosopher Iris Marion-Young’s distinction between groups and serial collectives in order to account for the reality of autism as a social category, best framed in terms of a social model of disability. When it is taken as a serial collective, I argue, we can coherently understand autistic people as forming a marginalized minority, disabled in relation to the specific material and social contexts, yet in a way that avoids neuro-centric commitments. Autism is thus real and valuable for political and ethical rather than biomedical reasons.",

            "abstract": "<p>Supports for the growing number of autistic university students often focus on helping them succeed in university. However, even educated autistic people experience discrimination and other challenges which can make it very difficult for them to obtain meaningful jobs. Little remains known about how universities can better support their autistic students and alumni in overcoming barriers to meaningful employment. In this participatory study, a team of autistic and non-autistic researchers asked autistic (<italic>n</italic> = 92) and non-autistic (<italic>n</italic> = 774) university students about their career aspirations, strengths they believe will help them succeed in their “dream jobs,” and obstacles they expect to encounter. Autistic participants’ top goal in attending college was to improve their career prospects. However, relatively few autistic students reported learning career-specific skills at university. Autistic students were more likely to seek an academic job and less likely to seek a career in healthcare than non-autistic students. Autistic students highlighted writing skills and detail orientation as strengths that could help them succeed in their dream jobs more often than non-autistic students. However, they were also more likely to expect discrimination, social, and psychological difficulties to stand in the way of their dream jobs. These findings suggest that universities should prioritize experiential learning opportunities to help autistic (and non-autistic) students develop employment-related skills while providing mental health supports. Universities should demonstrate their commitment to supporting diverse learners by seeking out and hiring autistic professionals and by teaching their own staff and employers how to appreciate and support autistic colleagues.</p>",

            "abstract": "Much of past research has been dedicated to refining the operationalization and correlates of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and less on how the BAP differs by socio-demographic characteristics, like age—particularly after midlife. This gap is important because other nonclinical trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) have shown considerable age differences, leading to work assessing the malleability of psychological characteristics and improving outcomes for individuals and their significant others. In the current study, we examined cross-sectional age differences in the BAP in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 18 to 85. We recruited a sample of 2966 adults ranging in age from 18 to 85 (Mage = 36.53, SD = 12.61; 58.9% Female; 1.1% with an ASD diagnosis) recruited from an online survey service. We found that total BAP scores were higher in younger adults and lower among older adults. These differences were particularly true for pragmatic language difficulties, with this component of the BAP showing the most dramatic age differences. Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of ASD and BAP traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in BAP. Lay Summary Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene.",

            "abstract": "Anecdotal evidence suggests that autistic people experience an elevated risk of homelessness, but systematic empirical research on this topic is lacking. As a step towards filling this gap in knowledge, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism symptoms in a group of long-term homeless people. The entire caseload ( N = 106) of a UK homeless outreach team was screened (excluding individuals born outside of the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland) using an in-depth, semi-structured interview with keyworkers, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) diagnostic criteria. This showed adequate inter-rater reliability, as well as evidence of criterion and construct validity. Of the sample, 13 people (12.3%, 95% confidence interval (7.0, 20.4)) screened positive, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism criteria by keyworker report. A further nine people (8.5%, 95% confidence interval (4.5, 15.3)) were ’marginal’, having autistic traits that were not quite sufficient to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) criteria. Those with elevated autistic traits, compared to those without, tended to be more socially isolated and less likely to use substances. This study has provided initial evidence that autistic traits are over-represented among homeless people and that autistic homeless people may show a distinct pattern of characteristics and needs. Further investigation is required to build upon these provisional findings.",

This study systematically reviewed empirical research examining healthcare professionals’ knowledge, self-efficacy and attitudes towards working with autistic people. Thirty-five studies were included. The included studies sampled a range of countries and professional backgrounds. A modified quality assessment tool found the quality of the included studies was moderately good. Narrative synthesis indicated that healthcare professionals report only moderate levels of autism knowledge and self-efficacy, and often lack training. Variation within and between countries and professional background was not explained by demographic factors. The reviewed evidence suggests health professionals’ limited knowledge and self-efficacy in working with autistic people is a challenge to the provision of healthcare for autistic individuals.",

            "abstract": "Many healthcare systems are organised such that General Practitioners (GPs) often have a key role in identifying autism spectrum disorders (hereafter collectively referred to as autism) in children. In this review, we explored what GPs know about autism and the factors that influence their ability to identify and manage care for their patients with autism in practice. We conducted a systematic narrative review using eight electronic databases. These included Embase and MEDLINE via Ovid, Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO via Ebscohost, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) via ProQuest. Our search yielded 2,743 citations. Primary research studies were included, and we did not impose any geographical, language or date restrictions. We identified 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Studies included in the review were conducted between 2003 and 2019. We thematically synthesised the material and identified the following themes: the prototypical image of a child with autism; experience, sources of information, and managing care; barriers to identification; strategies to aid in identification; and characteristics that facilitate expertise. Together, the findings from this review present a mixed picture of GP knowledge and experiences in identifying autism and managing care for children with the condition. At one end of the continuum, there were GPs who had not heard of autism or endorsed outmoded aetiological theories. Others, however, demonstrated a sound knowledge of the conditions but had limited confidence in their ability to identify the condition. Many GPs and researchers alike called for more training and this might be effective. However, framing the problem as one of a lack of training risks silences the array of organisational factors that impact on a GP’s ability to provide care for these patients.",

            "abstract": "<p>The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communicative difficulties between autistic and non-autistic people are due to bi-directional differences in communicative style and a reciprocal lack of understanding. If true, there should be increased similarity in interaction style, resulting in higher rapport during interactions between pairs of the same neurotype. Here, we provide two empirical tests of rapport, with data revealing whether self- and observer- rated rapport varies depending on the match or mismatch in autism status within a pair. An additional opportunity afforded by these data is to examine the effect of the autism status of the rater on the perceived rapport between matched and mismatched pairs. In Study 1 72 participants were allocated to one of three dyad conditions: autistic pairs (<italic>n</italic> = 24), non-autistic pairs (<italic>n</italic> = 24) and mixed pairs (<italic>n</italic> = 12 autistic; <italic>n</italic> = 12 non-autistic). Each participant completed three semi-structured interactions with their partner, rating rapport after each interaction. Non-autistic pairs experienced higher self-rated rapport than mixed and autistic pairs, and autistic pairs experienced higher rapport than mixed pairs. In Study 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 80) autistic and non-autistic observers rated interactional rapport while watching videoed interactions between autistic pairs, non-autistic pairs, and mixed pairs (<italic>n</italic> = 18, a subset of participants in Study 1). Mixed pairs were rated significantly lower on rapport than autistic and non-autistic pairs, and autistic pairs were rated more highly for rapport than non-autistic pairs. Both autistic and non-autistic observers show similar patterns in how they rate the rapport of autistic, non-autistic, and mixed pairs. In summary, autistic people experience high interactional rapport when interacting with other autistic people, and this is also detected by external observers. Rather than autistic people experiencing low rapport in all contexts, their rapport ratings are influenced by a mismatch of diagnosis. These findings suggest that autistic people possess a distinct mode of social interaction style, rather than demonstrating social skills deficits. These data are considered in terms of their implications for psychological theories of autism, as well as practical impact on educational and clinical practice.</p>",

            "abstract": "Autism is still diagnosed on the basis of subjective assessments of elusive notions such as interpersonal contact and social reciprocity. We propose to decompose reciprocal social interactions in their basic computational constituents. Specifically, we test the assumption that autistic individuals disregard information regarding the stakes of social interactions when adapting to others. We compared 24 adult autistic participants to 24 neurotypical (NT) participants engaging in a repeated dyadic competitive game against artificial agents with calibrated reciprocal adaptation capabilities. Critically, participants were framed to believe either that they were competing against somebody else or that they were playing a gambling game. Only the NT participants did alter their adaptation strategy when they held information regarding others’ competitive incentives, in which case they outperformed the AS group. Computational analyses of trial-by-trial choice sequences show that the behavioural repertoire of autistic people exhibits subnormal flexibility and mentalizing sophistication, especially when information regarding opponents’ incentives was available. These two computational phenotypes yield 79% diagnosis classification accuracy and explain 62% of the severity of social symptoms in autistic participants. Such computational decomposition of the autistic social phenotype may prove relevant for drawing novel diagnostic boundaries and guiding individualized clinical interventions in autism.",

            "abstract": "Autistic people face high unemployment rates. One reason for this may be that hiring processes are inaccessible. This study aimed to establish autistic people’s unique experiences of hiring processes in the United Kingdom, by comparing them to the experiences of non-autistic neurodivergent people and neurotypical people. Using qualitative and quantitative data from 225 autistic, 64 non-autistic neurodivergent and 88 neurotypical adults, we identified a series of (dis)similarities in participants’ views and experiences of recruitment for employment. Similarities across the three groups included (1) frustration with the focus on social skills; (2) a perceived need for more flexible hiring processes; (3) a desire for more clarity and (4) the importance of the environment. Participants also acknowledged the important role employers play in one’s decision to disclose a diagnosis or access need. Yet, autistic people faced a set of unique barriers to successful recruitment, over and above those that non-autistic people faced. For example, the perceived pressure to mask autistic traits to succeed and concerns about stigma and discrimination. Participants’ recommendations for improvements included the use of more practical recruitment strategies (e.g. work trials), more clarity about what to expect, and improvements in recruiters’ understanding of the challenges autistic and neurodivergent candidates may face.",

            "abstract": "Background: Emerging research suggests that seeking an autism diagnosis as an adult is usually difficult and time-consuming but brings relief once a diagnosis is made. This study explored the experience of the pathway to an autism diagnosis during adulthood for adults living in Australia. Methods: We conducted a qualitative phenomenological study and interviewed 13 adults who identified as autistic about their pathway to autism diagnosis in their mode of choice. Spoken interviews were transcribed verbatim, and transcripts were analyzed by using a thematic approach. Results: Data analysis resulted in 6 themes and 20 meaning units that described the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. These themes involved two interwoven journeys that spanned before, during, and after the diagnostic process. The personal journey involved feeling different, considering autism, and living as autistic, whereas the clinical journey involved missed opportunities, varied diagnostic experiences, and absent supports. Conclusions: Given the potential benefits for adults obtaining a formal autism diagnosis and accessing post-diagnostic supports, it is important that health professionals and governments collaborate to reduce access barriers and ensure adequate services are available. The findings from this study informed the development of Australia’s national guideline for autism diagnosis. Community brief Why is this an important issue? The experience of being diagnosed as autistic as an adult is not well understood, particularly in Australia. Research from other places, such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom, suggests that receiving an autism diagnosis in adulthood is difficult and time-consuming, but brings relief. We do not know whether this is the same for adults in Australia. What was the purpose of this study? This study aimed at exploring the experience of seeking an autism diagnosis during adulthood in Australia. What did the researchers do? We conducted interviews with 13 adults who identified as autistic about their pathway to an autism diagnosis. Three sets of interview questions were used, depending on whether they had already obtained an autism diagnosis, were going through the assessment process, or were self-diagnosed. Adults completed the interview in their mode of choice. Spoken interviews were transcribed word-for-word, and the transcripts were analyzed to identify common themes. What were the results of the study? We identified six themes that described the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. These themes involved two related journeys that spanned before, during, and after the diagnostic process. The personal journey involved feeling different, considering autism, and living as autistic. The clinical journey involved missed opportunities, varied diagnostic experiences, and absent supports. Before starting the diagnostic process in adulthood, participants described always feeling different and many missed opportunities to receive an autism diagnosis in their younger years. During the diagnostic process, participants described beginning to consider whether they were autistic and the varied pathways they underwent to confirm this. After the diagnostic process, participants described their experiences of living as autistic and a lack of post-diagnostic supports tailored to their needs. What do these findings add to what was already known? Our findings were similar to previous research findings from other countries, including the complex journey to diagnosis, relief and understanding on identifying as autistic, and lack of post-diagnostic services. However, to our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. Further, we included participants who did not have a formal diagnosis of autism. This group of people is often excluded from autism research, and their experiences of seeking an autism diagnosis are largely unknown. What are potential weaknesses in the study? The weaknesses of our study included recruiting a relatively small sample of mostly Caucasian females, and we did not consult with our study participants or other autistic adults to see whether our final themes aligned well with their experience. However, no new findings emerged in later interviews and our findings were similar to international literature. Future research should recruit more diverse groups of autistic adults and involve greater levels of autistic input. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? Our findings informed the development of the “National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Australia,” a first step toward improving autism diagnosis in Australia.",

            "abstract": "Background: Autistic adults receive unfavorable first impressions from typically developing (TD) adults, but these impressions improve when TD adults are made aware of their diagnosis. It remains unclear, however, how autistic adults form first impressions of other autistic adults, and whether their impressions are similarly affected by diagnostic awareness. Methods: In this study, 32 autistic and 32 TD adults viewed brief videos of 20 TD and 20 autistic adults presented either with or without their diagnostic status and rated them on character traits and their interest in interacting with them in the future. Results: Findings indicated that autistic raters shared the TD tendency to evaluate autistic adults less favorably than TD adults, but these judgments did not reduce their social interest for interacting with autistic adults as they did for TD raters. Furthermore, informing raters of the diagnostic status of autistic adults did not improve first impressions for autistic raters as they did for TD raters, suggesting that autistic raters either already inferred their autism status when no diagnosis was provided or their impression formation is less affected by awareness of a person’s diagnosis. Conclusions: Collectively, these results demonstrate that autistic observers make trait inferences about autistic adults comparable with those made by TD observers—suggesting a similar sensitivity to perceiving and interpreting social signifiers that differ between TD and autistic presentation styles—but unlike their TD counterparts, these trait judgments are not perceived as an impediment to subsequent social interaction and are relatively consistent regardless of diagnostic disclosure. Lay summary Why was this study done? Typically developing (TD) adults often form negative first impressions of autistic adults and report less of a desire to interact with them. These biases affect the social experiences of autistic adults and can contribute to their social disability. More optimistically, however, first impressions of autistic adults improve when TD adults are more knowledgeable about autism and are made aware of their diagnostic status, suggesting that familiarity and understanding can promote acceptance of autistic differences. One group that has high familiarity with autism is autistic adults themselves, but no study to date has examined how autistic adults form impressions of TD adults and other autistic adults. What was the purpose of this study? The purpose of this study was to examine whether first impressions of, and social interest in, autistic adults differ between autistic and TD raters, and determine whether disclosure of a person’s diagnosis affects these patterns differently for autistic and TD raters. What did the researchers do? A total of 32 TD and 32 autistic adult raters viewed videos of 40 unfamiliar adults (20 TD and 20 autistic individuals) and rated each person on six traits (awkwardness, attractiveness, assertiveness, likeability, trustworthiness, and intelligence) and four items assessing their social interest in future interaction with the person in the video. Videos were presented either with or without the person’s diagnosis to see whether this information affects impressions formed by autistic and TD raters. What were the results of the study? Consistent with prior work, TD raters formed more negative first impressions of autistic adults than TD adults. Meanwhile, autistic raters formed more positive impressions overall, but shared the TD pattern of rating autistic adults less favorably than TD adults on several traits. However, contrary to theories about reduced social motivation in autism, autistic raters expressed greater interest than TD raters in future interaction with people in the videos and this social interest was largest for other autistic people. Finally, diagnostic disclosure improved impressions of autistic adults made by TD raters but not by autistic raters. What do these findings add to what was already known? These findings provide empirical evidence that autistic adults detect and interpret autistic social differences similarly to TD adults, but they express greater inclusivity and less discriminatory attitudes about these differences. These results add to a growing literature about how autistic people are perceived, how these perceptions affect their social experiences, and how similarity between social partners can support social connection. What are potential weaknesses in the study? The included sample was predominantly Caucasian and male, and did not include participants with intellectual disability. Future studies should examine whether the patterns here extend to more diverse samples. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? This study provides additional evidence that social opportunities for autistic adults are affected by the perceptions and biases of potential social partners. Autistic observers may share the TD bias toward less favorable trait evaluation of autistic adults, but this did not lessen their social interest in interacting with autistic adults the way it did for TD observers. Opportunities for autistic adults to interact with other autistic adults may facilitate relationship development in this population who often struggle to have their social needs met. In addition, findings suggest that acceptance of autistic people increases with familiarity of autism itself. Improving attitudes about autism among TD people may be one effective way to improve the social experiences of autistic people within neurotypical environments.",

            "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by challenges in social communication and the presence of repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. Notably, males are four times as likely as females to be diagnosed with autism. Despite efforts to increase representation and characterization of autistic females, research studies consistently enroll small samples of females, or exclude females altogether. Importantly, researchers often rely on standardized measures to confirm diagnosis prior to enrollment in research studies. We retrospectively analyzed the effects of one such measure (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, ADOS) on research inclusion/exclusion rates by sex in autistic adults, all of whom had a preexisting community diagnosis of autism (n = 145, 95 male, 50 female). Using the ADOS as a confirmatory diagnostic measure resulted in the exclusion of autistic females at a rate over 2.5 times higher than that of autistic males. We compared sex ratios in our sample to those in other large, publically available datasets that rely either on community diagnosis (6 datasets, total n = 42,209) or standardized assessments (2 datasets, total n = 214) to determine eligibility of participants for research. Reliance on community diagnosis rather than confirmatory diagnostic assessments resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios. These results provide evidence for a “leaky” recruitment-to-research pipeline for females in autism research. Lay Summary Despite efforts to increase the representation of autistic females in research, studies consistently enroll small samples of females or exclude females altogether. We find that despite making up almost 50% of the initially recruited sample based upon self-report of community diagnosis, autistic females are disproportonately excluded from research participation as a result of commonly used autism diagnostic measures. In our sample, and several other publically available datasets, reliance on community diagnosis resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios.",

            "abstract": "Objectives Autistic people experience poor physical and mental health along with reduced life expectancy compared with non-autistic people. Our aim was to identify self-reported barriers to primary care access by autistic adults compared with non-autistic adults and to link these barriers to self-reported adverse health consequences. Design Following consultation with the autistic community at an autistic conference, Autscape, we developed a self-report survey, which we administered online through social media platforms. Setting A 52-item, international, online survey. Participants 507 autistic adults and 157 non-autistic adults. Primary and secondary outcome measures Self-reported barriers to accessing healthcare and associated adverse health outcomes. Results Eighty per cent of autistic adults and 37% of non-autistic respondents reported difficulty visiting a general practitioner (GP). The highest-rated barriers by autistic adults were deciding if symptoms warrant a GP visit (72%), difficulty making appointments by telephone (62%), not feeling understood (56%), difficulty communicating with their doctor (53%) and the waiting room environment (51%). Autistic adults reported a preference for online or text-based appointment booking, facility to email in advance the reason for consultation, the first or last clinic appointment and a quiet place to wait. Self-reported adverse health outcomes experienced by autistic adults were associated with barriers to accessing healthcare. Adverse outcomes included untreated physical and mental health conditions, not attending specialist referral or screening programmes, requiring more extensive treatment or surgery due to late presentations and untreated potentially life-threatening conditions. There were no significant differences in difficulty attending, barriers experienced or adverse outcomes between formally diagnosed and self-identified autistic respondents. Conclusions Reduction of healthcare inequalities for autistic people requires that healthcare providers understand autistic perspectives, communication needs and sensory sensitivities. Adjustments for autism-specific needs are as necessary as ramps for wheelchair users.",

            "abstract": "Objective: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by highly individualized neuroanatomical deviations that potentially map onto distinct genotypes and clinical phenotypes. This study aimed to link differences in brain anatomy to specific biological pathways to pave the way toward targeted therapeutic interventions. Methods: The authors examined neurodevelopmental differences in cortical thickness and their genomic underpinnings in a large and clinically diverse sample of 360 individuals with ASD and 279 typically developing control subjects (ages 6–30 years) within the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP). The authors also examined neurodevelopmental differences and their potential pathophysiological mechanisms between clinical ASD subgroups that differed in the severity and pattern of sensory features. Results: In addition to significant between-group differences in “core” ASD brain regions (i.e., fronto-temporal and cingulate regions), individuals with ASD manifested as neuroanatomical outliers within the neurotypical cortical thickness range in a wider neural system, which was enriched for genes known to be implicated in ASD on the genetic and/or transcriptomic level. Within these regions, the individuals’ total (i.e., accumulated) degree of neuroanatomical atypicality was significantly correlated with higher polygenic scores for ASD and other psychiatric conditions, and it scaled with measures of symptom severity. Differences in cortical thickness deviations were also associated with distinct sensory subgroups, especially in brain regions expressing genes involved in excitatory rather than inhibitory neurotransmission. Conclusions: The study findings corroborate the link between macroscopic differences in brain anatomy and the molecular mechanisms underpinning heterogeneity in ASD, and provide future targets for stratification and subtyping.",

            "abstract": "Purpose of review The steady rise in number of youth diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has led to the need to examine transition of care considerations specific to ASD. Improved understanding and guidance addressing these needs will allow pediatric and adult providers to work together to optimize social, medical, and occupational outcomes for these patients. Recent findings Health-care transition is a delicate time when children with ASD outgrow the services of pediatric programs and enter a fragmented healthcare system that is unfamiliar, insufficiently knowledgeable, and underfunded for their needs. Summary Increasing autism prevalence and an aging population with autism lend urgency to improve outcomes in children transitioning to adult-care. Research reveals poor consequences in social support, education, vocational training and employment, housing, and healthcare. Specific considerations to address these issues and ensure successful transition from pediatric to adult care are needed.",

            "abstract": "The number of students with ASD entering higher education is increasing. Ensuring that appropriate support structures are in place is imperative for their academic, social, and personal success. However, research on students with ASD often does not include student perspectives. Mismanagement of students’ transition into higher education institutions, coupled with a general lack of knowledge regarding their unique needs, can lead to anxiety, stigmatisation, bullying, and poor performance. The objective of this cross-sectional mixed-methods study was to explore the academic, social, institutional, and environmental challenges of students with ASD. Convenience sampling resulted in a sample of 74 students enrolled at a large, urban research university in the southeastern United States. Findings revealed significant differences between gender and use of support services, diagnosis disclosure, social engagement, and difficulties interacting with neurotypical people in an environment often perceived as ill-equipped to provide support. Consequently, potential institutional, programmatic, and policy implications emerged.",

            "abstract": "Autistic children grow to become autistic adults, and autism is increasingly diagnosed in adulthood and later life. This qualitative study aimed to understand experiences of autism throughout adulthood. A national cohort study of autistic adults and relatives of autistic adults (ASC-UK), enabled purposive recruitment of a diverse sample. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 autistic adults (aged 20–71 years), mostly diagnosed in adulthood, and 16 relatives (aged 31–81 years) of autistic adults diagnosed across both childhood and adulthood (including some with learning disability). Interview topics included health, relationships, education, employment, quality of life and everyday experiences. Thematic analysis of the accounts of the autistic adults identified six key themes relating to their experiences: (1) diagnosis as validating yet limiting; (2) supportive and non-supportive social agents; (3) the “invisibility” of the needs of autistic adults; (4) health in the context of autism; (5) staying “outside” the circle; and (6) multiple lives with autism. Data from relatives about autistic adult experiences gave additional perspectives on these themes. Experiences reported in other studies–of “difference” from others, challenges of social engagement, and learning to “conform” to society’s expectations–were evident and relevant to male and female autistic adults, across all age groups, and unrelated to stage of life when diagnosed. Some expressed disappointment with their lives, but others were proud of their achievements. Education and employment, whilst challenging for many, were also rewarding for some. Health care and social services were often experienced as inaccessible, inappropriate, or lacking understanding of the individual’s needs. We conclude that greater public understanding of autism as experienced in adulthood is needed. Key priorities are improving the availability of “appropriate” health and social care services for autistic adults and families, and providing practical support to enable enhanced participation in life.",

We evaluated symptom profiles of 245 Black and 488 sex- and age-matched White non-Hispanic participants (82.8% male; mean age: 4.2 years) referred for ASD diagnosis. Both groups showed similar overall levels of autistic symptoms. Black children had significantly but slightly lower scores on cognitive tests and on the Vineland communication domain than White children. Groups were comparable on internalizing and externalizing co-occurring problems. Given the largely similar clinical profiles, clinical differences in initial presentation may not be a primary reason for Black/White disparities in diagnostic and services use. Limitations of a cross-sectional referred sample are acknowledged.",

However, little is presently known about the demographics of gender-identity issues in autism spectrum disorder. Based upon what little is known, we hypothesized that there would be an increased prevalence of gender-dysphoria among those with autism spectrum disorder compared to a typically developing population. We surveyed gender-dysphoria with the Gender-Identity/Gender-Dysphoria Questionnaire among 90 males and 219 females with autism spectrum disorder and compared these rates to those of 103 males and 158 females without autism spectrum disorder. When compared to typically developing individuals, autistic individuals reported a higher number of gender-dysphoric traits. Rates of gender-dysphoria in the group with autism spectrum disorder were significantly higher than reported in the wider population. Mediation analysis found that the relationship between autistic traits and sexual orientation was mediated by gender-dysphoric traits. Results suggest that autism spectrum disorder presents a unique experience to the formation and consolidation of gender identity, and for some autistic individuals, their sexual orientation relates to their gender experience. It is important that clinicians working with autism spectrum disorder are aware of the gender-diversity in this population so that the necessary support for healthy socio-sexual functioning and mental well-being is provided.",

Little is presently known about the demographics of sexual orientation in ASD. Sexual Orientation was surveyed using the Sell Scale of Sexual Orientation in an international online sample of individuals with ASD (N = 309, M = 90, F= 219), aged (M = 32.30 years, SD = 11.93) and this was compared to sexual orientation of typically-developing individuals (N = 310, M = 84, F= 226), aged (M = 29.82 years, SD = 11.85). Findings suggested that sexual orientation was contingent on diagnosis (N = 570, \\chi2(9)=104.05, P < 0.001, \\varphi = 0.43). In the group with ASD, 69.7% of the sample reported being non-heterosexual, while in the TD group, 30.3% reported being non-heterosexual. The group with ASD reported higher rates of homosexuality, bisexuality and asexuality, but lower rates of heterosexuality. The results support the impression that non-heterosexuality is more prevalent in the autistic population. Increased non-heterosexuality in ASD has important clinical implications to target unique concerns of this population, and suggests a need for specialized sex education programs for autistic populations for increased support and awareness.

            "abstract": "Introduction Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) develop early in life and are thought to last a lifetime. However, ASC research has two major knowledge gaps that hinder progression in understanding the concept of ASC and in providing proper support for autistic adults: (1) the majority of knowledge about ASC mainly stems from childhood studies so little is known about older autistic adults and (2) while it is broadly recognised that ASC is a heterogeneous condition, we do not yet understand the differences in trajectories leading to their future outcome. We aim to fill both knowledge gaps. Methods and analysis A multistage overlapping cohort design assessing (cognitive) ageing in ASC is designed to obtain an accelerated longitudinal data set. Data, including a multitude of questionnaires, diagnostics and cognitive tests, are collected over four waves within a 10-year time frame. This will provide information regarding actual changes in quality of life, co-occurring health conditions and cognition as well as the possibility to test external validity and temporal stability in newly formed behavioural subtypes. Participants consist of three groups of adults aged 20–90 years: (1) with a clinical diagnosis of ASC, (2) with a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but no ASC, (3) no ASC/ADHD (ie, comparison group). The sample size differs between waves and instruments. Detailed analysis plans will be preregistered in AsPredicted or at the Open Science Framework. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the ethical review board of the Department of Psychology of the University of Amsterdam (wave 1 2011-PN-1952 and 2013-PN-2668, wave 2 2015-BC-4270, waves 3 and 4 2018-BC-9285). In line with the funding policies of the grant organisation funding this study, future papers will be published open access.",

            "abstract": "Autistic and non-autistic adults’ agreement with scientific knowledge about autism, how they define autism, and their endorsement of stigmatizing conceptions of autism has not previously been examined. Using an online survey, we assessed autism knowledge and stigma among 636 adults with varied relationships to autism, including autistic people and nuclear family members. Autistic participants exhibited more scientifically based knowledge than others. They were more likely to describe autism experientially or as a neutral difference, and more often opposed the medical model. Autistic participants and family members reported lower stigma. Greater endorsement of the importance of normalizing autistic people was associated with heightened stigma. Findings suggest that autistic adults should be considered autism experts and involved as partners in autism research.",

Alongside this, the concept of the “Autistic Advantage”, a strengths-based model, emphasises the ways in which Autistic people are assets to the social structures in which they exist. Two late diagnosed Autistic women, acknowledged as qualitative research experts, review the literature on Disability, neurodiversity and research; outline their own professional strengths; discuss their professional strengths in the light of the literature; and make recommendations for Autistic researchers and their neurotypical colleagues. Autistic qualities and preferences can be strengths in qualitative research teams. This includes long periods of concentration (hyperfocus), leading to “flow” and creative thinking, attention to detail, and detailed knowledge of topic areas that are of interest to the individual. We conclude that qualitative research teams can benefit from working inclusively with Autistic researchers. We present guidance to facilitate inclusive working, without which Autistic researchers may be Disabled by their work environment",

            "abstract": "Erving Goffman’s 1963 foundational discussion of stigma has been both embraced and critiqued in disability studies and other fields. In Goffman’s interactional and ahistorical analysis, stigma was presumed to exist as a natural feature of humanity, deflecting attention away from historical analysis. This article, in contrast, argues that stigma—particularly surrounding “mental illness”—is deeply embedded in historically contingent structural conditions of modern capitalism and ideologies of individualism that shape ideals of the modern worker. Specifically, I use the case of autism—and its commodification in the United States—to show how a stigmatized “mental illness” is intertwined with a range of financial interests that come to depend on the continued production of certain diagnoses. For example, an analysis of the “autism industrial complex” in the United States reveals how economic changes set the conditions for a range of practices that promise to reduce stigma; these include special education, activism/advocacy, and self-representation. These occur in the context of a transition toward more flexible employment and the increasing value of technological and artistic skills often associated with neurodiversity. Despite the fact that a capitalist logic continues to define valuations of personhood, families and autistic self-advocates have been empowered in recent years to use a variety of strategies to decouple stigma and illness and resist conventional definitions of autism as a syndrome of deficits.",

            "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1% of children. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample-size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with ASD and 27,969 controls that identified five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD.",

            "abstract": "While the medical home has proven effective at improving continuity of care among other populations, there is a paucity of literature testing the effectiveness of medical homes in serving the healthcare needs of autistic adults. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare the continuity of care of autistic adult patients at a specialized primary care medical home designed to remove barriers to care for autistic adults, called the Center for Autism Services and Transition (CAST), to propensity score matched national samples of autistic adults with private insurance or Medicare. The unadjusted median Bice–Boxerman continuity of care index was 0.6 (interquartile range = 0.4–1.0) for CAST patients, 0.5 (interquartile range = 0.3–1.0) for Medicare beneficiaries, and 0.6 (interquartile range = 0.4–1.0) for privately insured autistic adults. In multivariable models controlling for demographic characteristics, on average, CAST patients had continuity of care indices that were 10% higher than national samples of autistic adult Medicare beneficiaries (p < 0.0001). Continuity of care among CAST patients did not significantly differ from that of the national sample of privately insured autistic adults (p = 0.08). Our findings suggest that medical homes, like CAST, may be a promising solution to improve healthcare delivery for the growing population of autistic adults. Lay abstract There is a nationally recognized need for innovative healthcare delivery models to improve care continuity for autistic adults as they age out of pediatric and into adult healthcare systems. One possible model of care delivery is called the “medical home”. The medical home is not a residential home, but a system where a patient’s healthcare is coordinated through a primary care physician to ensure necessary care is received when and where the patient needs it. We compared the continuity of care among autistic adult patients at a specialized primary care medical home designed to remove barriers to care for autistic adults, called the CAST, to matched national samples of autistic adults with private insurance or Medicare. Continuity of primary care among CAST patients was significantly better than that of matched national samples of autistic adult Medicare beneficiaries and similar to that of privately insured autistic adults. Our findings suggest that medical homes, like CAST, are a promising solution to improve healthcare delivery for the growing population of autistic adults.",

            "abstract": "The concept of autism is a significant contribution from child psychiatry that has entered wider culture and public consciousness, and has evolved significantly over the last four decades. Taking a rather personal retrospective, reflecting on our own time in autism research, this review explores changes in the concept of autism and the implications of these for future research. We focus on seven major changes in how autism is thought of, operationalised, and recognised: (1) from a narrow definition to wide diagnostic criteria; (2) from a rare to a relatively common condition, although probably still under-recognised in women; (3) from something affecting children, to a lifelong condition; (4) from something discreet and distinct, to a dimensional view; (5) from one thing to many “autisms”, and a compound or “fractionable” condition; (6) from a focus on “pure” autism, to recognition that complexity and comorbidity is the norm; and finally, (7) from conceptualising autism purely as a “developmental disorder”, to recognising a neurodiversity perspective, operationalised in participatory research models. We conclude with some challenges for the field and suggestions for areas currently neglected in autism research.",

            "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by early childhood-onset impairments in communication and social interaction alongside restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests. This review summarizes recent developments in human genetics research in autism, complemented by epigenetic and transcriptomic findings. The clinical heterogeneity of autism is mirrored by a complex genetic architecture involving several types of common and rare variants, ranging from point mutations to large copy number variants, and either inherited or spontaneous (de novo). More than 100 risk genes have been implicated by rare, often de novo, potentially damaging mutations in highly constrained genes. These account for substantial individual risk but a small proportion of the population risk. In contrast, most of the genetic risk is attributable to common inherited variants acting en masse, each individually with small effects. Studies have identified a handful of robustly associated common variants. Different risk genes converge on the same mechanisms, such as gene regulation and synaptic connectivity. These mechanisms are also implicated by genes that are epigenetically and transcriptionally dysregulated in autism. Major challenges to understanding the biological mechanisms include substantial phenotypic heterogeneity, large locus heterogeneity, variable penetrance, and widespread pleiotropy. Considerable increases in sample sizes are needed to better understand the hundreds or thousands of common and rare genetic variants involved. Future research should integrate common and rare variant research, multi-omics data including genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, and refined phenotype assessment with multidimensional and longitudinal measures.",

However, most studies are clinic-based and liable to selection bias and major methodological problems. Methods We conducted a long-term follow-up study with 278 autistic individuals from our previous birth cohort study comprising 31,426 individuals. All participants were born in northern Yokohama between 1988 and 1996, diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by age seven, and followed up over 20?years. A total of 170 consented to participate in the study. Outcome measures included overall social functioning based on work, independent living, and friendships. Moreover, the time-use data concerning social participation and activities of daily living were compared with the general population. Results Psychosocial outcomes in adulthood (average age 25) were very good in 13.7%, good in 25.0%, fair in 31.0%, poor in 25.6%, and very poor in 4.8% of the participants. The majority participated in major life areas of and work and education (96.4%), sports (82.1%), and recreational activities and/or hobbies (98.8%).

            "abstract": "Adult autism studies are increasingly comprised of later-diagnosed adults, yet little is known about how these adults compare to those diagnosed earlier in life. The present study examines medical and psychiatric conditions endorsed by autistic adults and documents differences between those diagnosed with ASD in childhood versus adulthood, as well as across age groups and sex at birth. 4657 legally independent adults (ages 18–85, M = 33.4 years) with professional ASD diagnoses who completed a medical questionnaire were drawn from the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge (SPARK) study. Chi square analyses, t-tests, and logistic regressions were used to compare medical and psychiatric conditions between age groups, sex at birth and adults diagnosed in childhood (before age 21) versus adulthood (at or after 21 years). Overall number of conditions endorsed as being diagnosed by a professional was high, with an average of 1.69 (SD = 2.01) medical or developmental and 2.98 (SD = 2.29) psychiatric conditions reported across the sample. Females were more likely to endorse psychiatric conditions (OR = 1.68). Adult-diagnosed adults were more likely to endorse psychiatric conditions (OR = 2.71) and reported more lifetime psychiatric diagnoses (M = 3.15, SD = 2.23) than their childhood-diagnosed counterparts (M = 2.81, SD = 2.33). These findings underscore the need for research to better understand and treat co-occurring psychiatric conditions in autistic adults and report and consider the age of diagnosis in adult autism samples. Moreover, results suggest it is imperative that mental health professionals receive autism training to promote accurate differential diagnosis and equitable access to mental health care for autistic adults with co-occurring psychiatric conditions.",

Although, it is well-documented that autistic people experienced many barriers to accessing health services, little is known about their challenges in accessing homeless services. Thus, the present study aimed to measure prevalence of high levels of autistic traits, and to identify barriers that prevent autistic people accessing homeless services. Participants recruited from homeless services (n = 65) completed the Autism Quotient-10 (AQ-10) alongside a questionnaire regarding perceived accessibility of homeless services. Results revealed that 18.5% of participants scored Above the Clinical Threshold of the AQ-10 (ACT-AQ). Moreover, the ACT-AQ group reported that encountering big groups in shared accommodation represent a significant barrier to engaging with homeless services. Further research is needed to identify the full degree of ASC representation and the factors that might prevent autistic homeless people accessing homeless services, and thus overcoming homelessness.",

            "abstract": "Background Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by behavioural, communication and social impairments. The prevalence of sleep disturbances in children with ASD is 40–80%, with significant effects on quality of life for the children and carers., This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence of the effects of behavioural interventions to improve sleep among children with ASD. Methods Databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, Autism Data, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Current Controlled Trials) were searched for published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia in children with autism spectrum conditions. Results Three studies met the inclusion criteria, one provided actigraphy data, one Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) data, and one both actigraphy and CSHQ data for use in meta-analyses. There were significant differences between the behavioural intervention and comparison groups (actigraphy data) for total sleep time (24.41 minutes, 95% CI 5.71, 43.11, P = 0.01), sleep latency (-18.31 minutes, 95% CI -30.84, -5.77, P = 0.004) and sleep efficiency (5.59%, 95% CI 0.87, 10.31, P = 0.02). There was also a favourable intervention effect evident for the subjective CSHQ data (-4.71, 95% CI -6.70, -2.73, P<0.00001). Risk of bias was low across several key domains (randomisation, allocation concealment and reporting), with some studies being unclear due to poor reporting. Conclusions There are very few high quality randomised controlled trials in this area. Here we provide initial synthesised quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of behavioural interventions for treating sleep problems in children with ASD.

            "abstract": "Autism spectrum conditions comprise a set of early-onset neurodevelopmental syndromes with a prevalence of 1% across all ages. First diagnosis in adulthood has finally become recognised as an important clinical issue due to the increasing awareness of autism, broadening of diagnostic criteria, and the introduction of the spectrum concept. Thus, the idea of a lost generation of people who were previously excluded from a diagnosis of classic autism has arisen. Making a first diagnosis of autism spectrum conditions in adults can be challenging for practical reasons (eg, no person to provide a developmental history), developmental reasons (eg, the acquisition of learnt or camouflaging strategies), and clinical reasons (eg, high frequency of co-occurring disorders). The diagnostic process includes referral, screening, interviews with informants and patients, and functional assessments. In delineating differential diagnoses, true comorbidities, and overlapping behaviour with other psychiatric diagnoses, particular attention should be paid to anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, personality disorders, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Possible misdiagnosis, especially in women, should be explored. The creation of supportive, accepting, and autism-friendly social and physical environments is important and requires a coordinated effort across agencies and needs support from government policies.",

            "abstract": "The present longitudinal study investigated changes in service receipt and unmet service needs spanning 14 years before and after high school exit in a large community-based sample of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 204), of whom 59% had co-occurring intellectual disability (ID). Using multilevel models, potential discontinuity of service patterns at the point of high school exit was examined, as well as the rate of change in services received and needed during the high school years and into the post-high school period. Differences between those with and without ID were probed. Study findings indicated that overall, sample members experienced a reduction in receipt of services during high school, particularly for those without co-occurring ID. After high school exit, sample members experienced a decline in services received; for those without ID, there was a continuous rate of loss of services after leaving high school but for those with ID, there was a sharp decline in services received. Unmet service needs increased right after high school exit for both those with and without ID. These patterns reflect loss of entitlement for services that accompanies high school exit, and the limited availability of adult services for individuals with ASD. This study documented not only the post-high school service cliff that has been the subject of much concern, but also that the loss of services begins long before high school exit and that subgroups of the population with ASD are particularly vulnerable.

Lay Summary In this research, we studied changes in the number of services received before and after high school exit in a large sample of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). With each passing year during high school, individuals with ASD received fewer services. At the time of high school exit, there was a sharp drop in the number of services received, particularly for those with co-occurring intellectual disability. This study found not only that there is a post-high school service cliff, but also that the loss of services begins long before high school exit.",

            "abstract": "The growth of autistic self-advocacy and the neurodiversity movement has brought about new ethical, theoretical and ideological debates within autism theory, research and practice. These debates have had genuine impact within some areas of autism research but their influence is less evident within early intervention research. In this paper, we argue that all autism intervention stakeholders need to understand and actively engage with the views of autistic people and with neurodiversity as a concept and movement. In so doing, intervention researchers and practitioners are required to move away from a normative agenda and pay diligence to environmental goodness-of-fit, autistic developmental trajectories, internal drivers and experiences, and autistic prioritized intervention targets. Autism intervention researchers must respond to these debates by reframing effectiveness, developing tools to measure autistic prioritized outcomes, and forming partnerships with autistic people. There is a pressing need for increased reflection and articulation around how intervention practices align with a neurodiversity framework and greater emphasis within intervention programmes on natural developmental processes, coping strategies, autonomy, and well-being.",

            "abstract": "The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) controversially combined previously distinct subcategories of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) into a single diagnostic category. However, genetic convergences and divergences between different ASD subcategories are unclear. By retrieving 1725 exonic de novo mutations (DNMs) from 1628 subjects with autistic disorder (AD), 1873 from 1564 subjects with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), 276 from 247 subjects with Asperger’s syndrome (AS), and 2077 from 2299 controls, we found that rates of putative functional DNMs (loss-of-function, predicted deleterious missense, and frameshift) in all three subcategories were significantly higher than those in control. We then investigated the convergences and divergences of the three ASD subcategories based on four genetic aspects: whether any two ASD subcategories (1) shared significantly more genes with functional DNMs, (2) exhibited similar spatio-temporal expression patterns, (3) shared significantly more candidate genes, and (4) shared some ASD-associated functional pathways. It is revealed that AD and PDD-NOS were broadly convergent in terms of all four genetic aspects, suggesting these two ASD subcategories may be genetically combined. AS was divergent to AD and PDD-NOS for aspects of functional DNMs and expression patterns, whereas AS and AD/PDD-NOS were convergent for aspects of candidate genes and functional pathways. Our results indicated that the three ASD subcategories present more genetic convergences than divergences, favouring DSM-5’s new classification. This study suggests that specifically defined genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes should be integrated analyzed for precise diagnosis of complex disorders, such as ASD.",

            "abstract": "Most adults on the autism spectrum have co-occurring mental health conditions, creating a high demand for mental health services – including psychotherapy – in autistic adults. However, autistic adults have difficulties accessing mental health services. The most-reported barriers to accessing treatment are therapists’ lack of knowledge and expertise surrounding autism, as well as unwillingness to treat autistic individuals. This study was conducted by a participatory autism research group and examined 498 adult-patient psychotherapists on knowledge about autism and self-perceived competency to diagnose and treat autistic patients without intellectual disability compared to patients with other diagnoses. Psychotherapists rated their education about autism in formal training, and competency in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with autism, lowest compared to patients with all other diagnoses surveyed in the study, including those with comparable prevalence rates. Many therapists had misconceptions and outdated beliefs about autism. Few had completed additional training on autism, but the majority were interested in receiving it. Greater knowledge about autism was positively linked to openness to accept autistic patients. The results point to an alarming gap in knowledge necessary for adequate mental health care for individuals with autism. Lay abstract Most autistic adults experience mental health problems. There is a great demand for psychotherapeutic support that addresses the specific needs of autistic individuals. However, people with autism encounter difficulties trying to access diagnostic and therapeutic services. This study was conducted by a participatory autism research group: a group in which autistic individuals and scientists collaborate. The group developed a questionnaire for psychotherapists in Germany to assess their knowledge about autism. Psychotherapists also rated their ability to diagnose and treat autistic patients without intellectual disability, and patients with other psychological diagnoses. Many of the 498 psychotherapists that responded reported little knowledge and outdated beliefs about autism, as well as little training on treating patients with autism. Their expertise about other psychological conditions was more comprehensive. However, many psychotherapists were interested in professional training on autism. Those with more knowledge were also more open to treating autistic patients. In conclusion, psychotherapists’ lack of knowledge and expertise seem to be a major barrier for adults with autism to receiving helpful psychotherapeutic support. The results demonstrate the need for an advancement in autism education during psychotherapists’ training and in continuous education.",

This study aims to further our understanding of the relationship between the Autism-Spectrum Quotient Scale and age in a large adult sample., Methods: The present study examines the relationship of Autism-Spectrum Quotient Scale (AQ) scores with age in 1139 adults, ages 18–97 years. Participants came from three distinct samples—a sample of primarily students, a sample of MTurk participants, and a sample of primarily community dwelling older adults. The majority of the participants did not self-report an autism diagnosis (91%), were female (67%), and identified as White (81%). Participants completed the AQ primarily via online surveys. Researchers scored the AQ following six common scoring practices., Results: Results of preregistered analyses indicate that autism characteristics measured by the AQ are not strongly associated with age (r values from -0.01 to -0.11). Further findings indicate that the measurement of autism characteristics is consistent across age into late life using both multiple groups and local structural equation modeling approaches to measurement invariance (comparative fit indices = 0.82–0.83, root mean square error = 0.06) as well as reliability analysis. Finally, demographic and autism-related variables (sex, race, self-identified autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, and degree of autism characteristics) did not moderate the relationship between age and autism characteristics., Conclusion: These results suggest that self-reports of autism characteristics using the AQ do not vary strongly by age in this large age-representative sample. Findings suggest that the AQ can potentially serve as a useful tool for future research on autism across the life span.

            "abstract": "The current manuscript replicates and extends the few existing studies of generativity in later adulthood with regard to two aims: (a) to model individual differences in the development of generativity into early late life and (b) to examine the relationship between development in generativity and development in well-being into late midlife and early late life. Data from the Rochester Adult Longitudinal Study (RALS) are used to address these aims in a preregistered secondary analysis of existing RALS data (see https://osf.io/syp2u). Analyses quantify individual development of generativity in a sample of 271 RALS participants who completed the Loyola Generativity Scale (LGS; McAdams & de St. Aubin, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1992, 62, p. 1003) and the Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWB; Ryff, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1989a, 57, p. 1069) during the most recent two waves of the RALS (2000–2012). Generativity demonstrated substantial rank-order stability but no mean-level change. There was substantial variability in both stability and change. Dual score change models showed a robust concurrent relationship between generativity and well-being at the first assessment and meaningful correlated change over time. While demographic and social role covariates were not associated with study findings, one of the most important limitations of the RALS is the racial and ethnic homogeneity of the sample, which constrains generalizability and potentially may restrict the range of these variables. Results are discussed in the context of our current understanding of the development and impact of generativity in later adulthood, and directions for future research in this area are identified.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To derive the first systematically calculated estimate of the relative proportion of boys and girls with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through a meta-analysis of prevalence studies conducted since the introduction of the DSM-IV and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. METHOD: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched, and study quality was rated using a risk-of-bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used. The pooled outcome measurement was the male-to-female odds ratio (MFOR), namely the odds of being male in the group with ASD compared with the non-ASD group. In effect, this is the ASD male-to-female ratio, controlling for the male-to-female ratio among participants without ASD. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies were analyzed, with 13,784,284 participants, of whom 53,712 had ASD (43,972 boys and 9,740 girls). The overall pooled MFOR was 4.20 (95% CI 3.84-4.60), but there was very substantial between-study variability (I2 = 90.9%). High-quality studies had a lower MFOR (3.32; 95% CI 2.88-3.84). Studies that screened the general population to identify participants regardless of whether they already had an ASD diagnosis showed a lower MFOR (3.25; 95% CI 2.93-3.62) than studies that only ascertained participants with a pre-existing ASD diagnosis (MFOR 4.56; 95% CI 4.10-5.07). CONCLUSION: Of children meeting criteria for ASD, the true male-to-female ratio is not 4:1, as is often assumed; rather, it is closer to 3:1. There appears to be a diagnostic gender bias, meaning that girls who meet criteria for ASD are at disproportionate risk of not receiving a clinical diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "Longitudinal data on the functioning of adults referred for possible autism as children are sparse and possibly different from datasets consisting of adult clinical referrals. A total of 123 young adults, mean age of 26, referred for neurodevelopmental disorders in early childhood were categorized into three outcome groups: autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis at some point and current intelligence quotient (IQ) ⩾ 70 (Ever ASD-Higher IQ), ever ASD and current IQ < 70 (Ever ASD-Lower IQ), and individuals who never received an ASD diagnosis (Never ASD). Independence and well-being were assessed through direct testing, questionnaires, and interviews. Verbal IQ, beyond intellectual disability status, accounted for group differences in employment; autistic features (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Calibrated Severity Score) were uniquely related to adaptive skills and friendships. In many ways, the Never ASD group had similar outcomes compared to the ASD groups. However, lower well-being and fewer positive emotions were related to ASD diagnosis across IQ. The Ever ASD-Lower IQ group had the highest levels of irritability, hyperactivity, and medications. Families played a major role in supporting adults with and without ASD at all intellectual levels. Realistic ways of increasing independence should be developed through working with adults and their families, while acknowledging the contribution of individual differences in mental health, intelligence, and autism symptoms across neurodevelopmental disorders. Lay abstract It is important to better understand how adults with autism are functioning in adulthood. Studies that have tracked individuals across the lifespan can help identify developmental factors influence differences in adult outcomes. The present study examines the independence, well-being, and functioning of 123 adults that have been closely followed since early childhood. Autism diagnosis and cognitive assessments were given frequently throughout childhood and during adulthood. We examined differences between adults who had received an autism diagnosis at some point with higher cognitive abilities (Ever ASD-High IQ) and lower cognitive abilities (Ever ASD-Low IQ), as well as adults who never received a diagnosis of autism in the course of the study (Never ASD). We found that autistic features specifically related to adaptive skills and friendships, and verbal intelligence related to work outcomes. In many ways, the Never ASD group had similar outcomes compared to the ASD groups. However, adults with ASD tended to have lower well-being and fewer positive emotions. Families played a major role in supporting adults with and without ASD at all intellectual levels. The findings suggest that realistic ways of increasing independence need to be developed by working with adults and their families, while acknowledging the contribution of individual differences in mental health, intelligence and autism symptoms across neurodevelopmental disorders.",

            "abstract": "Most individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)—a complex, life-long developmental disorder—do not have access to the care required to address their diverse health needs. Here, we review: (1) common barriers to healthcare access (shortage/cost of services; physician awareness; stigma); (2) barriers encountered primarily during childhood (limited screening/diagnosis; unclear referral pathways), transition to adulthood (insufficient healthcare transition services; suboptimal physician awareness of healthcare needs) and adulthood (shortage of services/limited insurance; communication difficulties with physicians; limited awareness of healthcare needs of aging adults); and (3) advances in research/program development for better healthcare access. A robust understanding of barriers to accessing healthcare across the lifespan of autistic individuals is critical to ensuring the best use of healthcare resources to improve social, physical, and mental health outcomes. Stakeholders must strengthen healthcare service provision by coming together to: better understand healthcare needs of underserved populations; strengthen medical training on care of autistic individuals; increase public awareness of ASD; promote research into/uptake of tools for ASD screening, diagnosis, and treatment; understand specific healthcare needs of autistic individuals in lower resource countries; and conduct longitudinal studies to understand the lifetime health, social, and economic impacts of ASD and enable the evaluation of novel approaches to increasing healthcare access.",

            "abstract": "Background Having a mental health condition is related to significantly lower subjective Quality of Life (QoL) for people on the autism spectrum. Many autistic people do not participate in so-called “normative” outcomes, i.e. the achievement of lifecourse goals judged to be important by adults in the general population (e.g. being employed). This study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between the presence of mental health conditions, subjective QoL and participation in normative outcomes in older autistic people. Methods 69 autistic people (n = 48 males) aged 55 years and over were identified from two studies that are part of the UK Autism Spectrum Adulthood and Ageing research programme. Participants provided demographic data to establish normative outcome participation, and completed the World Health Organisation (WHO) QoL measure (WHOQoL-BREF) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Illustrative quotes focusing on normative outcomes were available from in-depth interviews (n = 8). Results QoL scores across all domains were lower for individuals who met indicative clinical cut-offs for depression (F(8,126) = 6.171, p < 0.001); findings were similar for anxiety (F(8,126) = 3.902, p < 0.001). Subjective QoL did not differ according to participation in normative outcomes (F(12,124.64) = 1.363, p = 0.192). The illustrative quotes suggested that aspects of daily life were related to QoL (i.e. friendships). Conclusions For older autistic people, the presence and severity of a likely mental health condition (i.e anxiety and depression) were associated with poorer QoL. However, participation in general population lifecourse goals may not well represent QoL of older autistic people, suggesting that service supports should be individually responsive.",

            "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that the defining characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are distributed throughout the general population; hence, understanding correlates of aging in people with high autistic traits could shed light on ASD and aging. 915 members of the Dunedin longitudinal birth cohort completed a measure of autistic traits at age 45. A composite measure of the “pace of aging” was derived by tracking decline in 19 biomarkers across ages 26, 32, 38, and 45 years. Facial age was also assessed. Reports of perceived health were collected from participants themselves, informants, and interviewers. Higher self-reported autistic traits significantly correlated with a faster pace of aging, older facial age, and poorer self-, informant- and interviewer-rated health. After control for sex, SES and IQ, autistic traits were significantly associated with each variable: pace of aging (\\beta=0.09), facial age (\\beta=0.08), self- (\\beta=-.15), informant (\\beta=-.12), and interviewer-rated (\\beta=-.17) health. Autistic traits measured at age 45 are associated with faster aging. Participants with high autistic traits appear to be more vulnerable to poor health outcomes, as previously reported for those clinically diagnosed with ASD. Therefore, autistic traits may have important health implications. Replicating these findings in samples of autistic people is needed to identify the mechanism of their effect on aging and physical health to improve outcomes for those with ASD diagnoses or high autistic traits., The role that autistic traits have in relation to health outcomes has not been investigated. We looked at how physical health and aging (measured with self-reported questions and decline in multiple biological measures) were related to autistic traits (measured with a questionnaire, at age 45). We found that higher autistic traits were associated with poorer reports of physical health, and a faster pace of aging. This suggests that both those with autism and those with higher autistic traits may be more likely to experience poorer health outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Autism spectrum condition is associated with co-occurring physical health conditions and premature mortality. Autistic people experience multiple barriers to accessing healthcare. This study investigated autistic people’s experiences of healthcare and professionals’ experiences of providing healthcare to autistic people. Focus groups with 11 autistic people and one supporter, and 15 one-to-one interviews with healthcare professionals were completed. Nine themes emerged from the autistic participants’ data and eight themes emerged from the health professionals’ data. Three themes were identified by both groups: healthcare contacts (for improving the patient–provider relationship), making reasonable adjustments to healthcare (e.g. providing alternative places to wait for an appointment) and autism diagnosis. Autistic participants discussed the role of cognitive factors in the success of healthcare visits (such as rehearsing an anticipated conversation with the clinician the night before an appointment) and clinicians described system-level constraints that may affect healthcare delivery (such as time limits on appointments). This study identified inexpensive changes that health professionals and managers can make to improve healthcare access for autistic people. Lay abstract Research has shown that on average, autistic people are more likely to die earlier than non-autistic people, and barriers can stop autistic people accessing healthcare. We carried out a study where we interviewed healthcare professionals (including doctors and nurses), and held discussion groups of autistic people. Our results highlighted several key points: seeing the same professional is important for autistic people and clinicians; both clinicians and autistic people think making adjustments to healthcare is important (and often possible); autistic people process information in a different way and so may need extra support in appointments; and that clinicians are often constrained by time pressures or targets.",

            "abstract": "Background: There is a paucity of research involving older autistic people, as highlighted in a number of systematic reviews. However, it is less clear whether this is changing, and what the trends might be in research on autism in later life. Methods: We conducted a broad review of the literature by examining the number of results from a search in three databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO) across four age groups: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and older age. We also examined the abstracts of all the included articles for the older age group and categorized them under broad themes. Results: Our database search identified 145 unique articles on autism in older age, with an additional 67 found by the authors (hence, the total number of articles in this review is 212). Since 2012, we found a 392% increase in research with older autistic people, versus 196% increase for childhood/early life, 253% for adolescence, and 264% for adult research. We identify 2012 as a point at which, year-on-year, older age autism research started increasing, with the most commonly researched areas being cognition, the brain, and genetics. However, older adult research only accounted for 0.4% of published autism studies over the past decade. Conclusions: This increase reflects a positive change in the research landscape, although research with children continues to dominate. We also note the difficulty of identifying papers relevant to older age autism research, and propose that a new keyword could be created to increase the visibility and accessibility of research in this steadily growing area. Community brief Why is this topic important? Autistic children grow into autistic adults, and autistic adults grow old. However, there is very little research about older autistic people. This is important so we know how to support older autistic people. What is the purpose of this article? We wanted to examine how autism research activity has changed over time with respect to four life stages: infancy, childhood and adolescence, adulthood, and older age. We then more closely looked at older age autism research to point out important gaps where more research is needed. What did the authors do? We conducted a broad review of the literature on autism and described what life stages are studied in published research. We looked at how the amount of research on different life stages has changed over time. We further examined studies focused on older age and summarized the topics covered. What did you find about this topic? Our review estimates that only 0.4% of autism-related publications over the past decade are about older autistic people. We identify 2012 as a turning point since when the number of studies has markedly increased year-on-year. Encouragingly, the percentage increase in autism research over the past decade is greater for older age research (392% rise) than childhood/early life (196%), adolescence (253%), or adulthood research (264%). What do the authors recommend? We suggest that there are many research areas that need addressing. Specifically, more research is needed on social isolation and the practicalities of living arrangements for older autistic people, as well as more studies including older autistic adults with intellectual disability. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? We do not think that our findings will immediately benefit the lives of autistic people. However, we do hope to draw attention to topics where research is needed to improve the lives of autistic older people. We also suggest that a new keyword could be created that researchers could then include in their articles to help autistic people and those interested in autism and aging find relevant writings.",

            "abstract": "Background: A population segment of autistic adults are underidentified due, in part, to historic changes in criteria for diagnosing autism and diagnostic biases related to gender, socioeconomic status, and other individual characteristics such as intellectual functioning. Some of these individuals, described as the “lost generation,” may choose to self-diagnose. Although little is known about this population, it is possible that they share similar self-conceptualizations or internalized stigma as their diagnosed counterparts. This study reports on the structural validity of the Autism Spectrum Identity Scale (ASIS) with individuals diagnosed and self-diagnosed with autism and compares the demographic characteristics, stigma, self-concept, and quality of life of these two groups. Methods: Over 1000 adults diagnosed (n = 893) or self-diagnosed (n = 245) with autism were recruited through organizations serving the autism community to participate in a nationally distributed online survey that included demographic questions and measures for stigma, self-concept, quality of life, and well-being. The diagnosed data set was randomly split with exploratory factor analysis performed on a training data set. Split-half cross-validation was used to predict the factor structure of the holdout data set. Then, the full diagnosed data set structure was used to determine the generalizability of the factor structure to the self-diagnosed data set. The diagnosed and self-diagnosed were also compared for differences in gender, age, employment status, diagnostic term preference, and factors of self-concept (autism identity and self-esteem), stigma, and quality of life. Results: Factor analysis of diagnosed participants yielded a four-factor structure, consistent with previous research, with strong split-sample cross-validation and good internal consistency. Factor predictions of the self-diagnosed data set from the diagnosed data set ranged from 0.97 to 1.00 with similar internal consistency. Self-diagnosed participants were more likely to be older, women, or employed and less likely to be students or prefer the term “autism” than those with an autism diagnosis. The groups were remarkably similar in reported stigma, self-esteem, quality of life, and in ASIS factors; both groups reported lower quality of life than the general population. Conclusions: The ASIS demonstrated the same internal structure with both the diagnosed and self-diagnosed samples. The profile of self-diagnosed participants matches the profile hypothesized for the “lost generation” and others at risk of being underidentified for autism. Both populations appear to be similarly struggling with employment, stigma, and quality of life. Future research should examine whether self-diagnosed individuals meet criteria for autism or could benefit from interventions, programs, or services serving autism communities.",

            "abstract": "Data from an online survey of undergraduate students at 14 colleges and universities were used to estimate the association of autism with six physical and mental health outcomes, accounting for comorbidity with other disabilities (learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory impairment, mobility impairment, mental health disorder, or other disabilities). Autism status was determined based on registration for disability accommodations based on autism and/or self-reports of an autism diagnosis. Health outcomes included self-rated physical health, self-rated mental health, depressive symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, sleep deprivation, and binge drinking. Students with autism reported poorer self-rated physical and mental health, more depressive symptoms, and more symptoms of anxiety than other students, even in the presence of controls for other disabilities. Students with autism also reported a lower likelihood of sleep deprivation and binge drinking than other students. Our results extend previous research on the health correlates of autism by considering additional indicators of health and by incorporating a direct comparison to neurotypical students. They encourage consideration of how health services for students with autism can be improved, especially for mental health problems, and argue for integrated support services that address the full constellation of physical and mental health challenges that students on the spectrum experience. Lay abstract Studies have shown that children and older adults on the autism spectrum experience more physical and mental health problems than their neurotypical peers. Less is known about the physical and mental health of college students on the spectrum. Studying college students is important because young adults on the spectrum are enrolling in college at increasing rates and because health problems can be a barrier to succeeding in college. We collected data from 2820 students at 14 colleges and universities using an online survey, some of whom had registered for accommodations based on autism and others of whom had not. We used the data to compare the physical and mental health of students on the spectrum to their neurotypical peers. Because students with autism often report other disabilities that also affect health, we accounted for whether they experienced a learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory impairment, mobility impairment, mental health disorder, or any other disabilities. We assessed health using self-reports of how healthy they were physically and mentally, and reports of depressive symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, sleep deprivation, and binge drinking. We found that students with autism reported poorer physical and mental health, more depressive symptoms, and more symptoms of anxiety even after taking into account other disabilities they may have experienced. They were also less likely to report sleep deprivation and binge drinking. Our results argue for developing specialized services to address the physical and mental health challenges of college students on the spectrum.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades there has been much debate over the ontological status of autism and other neurological “disorders”, diagnosed by behavioural indicators, and theorised primarily within the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychological paradigms. Such cognitive-behavioural discourses abstain from acknowledging the universal issue of relationality and interaction in the formation of a contested and constantly reconstructed social reality, produced through the agency of its “actors”. The nature of these contested interactions will be explored in this current issues piece through the use of the term the “double empathy problem”, and how such a rendition produces a critique of autism being defined as a deficit in “theory of mind”, re-framing such issues as a question of reciprocity and mutuality. In keeping with other autistic self-advocates, this piece will refer to “autistic people”, and “those who identify as on the autism spectrum”, rather than “people with autism”.",

            "abstract": "This article proposes a link between autistic people being misperceived by the neurotypical majority and their being at risk of poor mental health and well-being. We present a transactional account of development in which the misperceptions (and consequent behaviour) of the neurotypical majority influences the perceptions and behaviour of autistic people such that they become increasingly separate and indeed isolated from mainstream society. This jeopardizes their mental health and prevents autistic people from developing to full potential. The situation is not only problematical for the development of autistic people but is also to the detriment of wider society, in so far as autistic people are effectively prevented from contributing fully. This account assumes that some (not necessarily all) autistic people yearn to be included, to be productive and to be useful. It thus directly opposes accounts that view autism as an extreme case of diminished social motivation.",

            "abstract": "Somatic disorders occur more often in adult psychiatric patients than in the general adult population. However, in child and adolescent psychiatry this association is unclear, mainly due to a lack of integration of existing data. To address this issue, we here present a systematic review on medical comorbidity in the two major developmental disorders autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and formulate clinical recommendations. The literature was searched using the PubMed and PsycINFO databases (2000–1 May 2016) with the keywords “[((child and adolescent) AND (Autism OR Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder* OR ADHD)) AND (“Cardiovascular Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Endocrine System Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Immune System Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Neurobehavioral Manifestations” [Mesh] OR “Gastrointestinal Disorders” [Mesh] OR Somatic OR Autoimmune disease OR Nervous system disease OR Infection OR Infectious disease)]. Two raters independently assessed the quality of the eligible studies. The initial search identified 5278 articles. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria 104 papers were selected and subsequently subjected to a quality control. This quality was assessed according to a standardized and validated set of criteria and yielded 29 studies for inclusion. This thorough literature search provides an overview of relevant articles on medical comorbidity in ADHD and/or ASD, and shows that medical disorders in these children and adolescents appear to be widespread. Those who work with children with ASD and/or ADHD should be well aware of this and actively promote routine medical assessment. Additionally, case–control studies and population-based studies are needed to provide reliable prevalence estimates. Future studies should furthermore focus on a broader evaluation of medical disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD and/or ASD to improve treatment algorithm in this vulnerable group.",

Our academic–community partnership used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct semi-structured, open-ended interviews with 39 autistic adults and 16 people who had experience supporting autistic adults in healthcare settings. Participants identified patient-level, autism-related factors that impact healthcare interactions, including verbal communication skills, sensory sensitivities, challenges with body awareness, slow processing speed, atypical non-verbal communication, and challenges with organization. However, the success of healthcare interactions largely depended on the interplay between patient- and provider-level factors, as well as the larger context in which patients were receiving care. Provider-level factors included providers’ knowledge about autism in adults, incorrect assumptions about individual patients, willingness to allow written communication, use of accessible language, openness to providing other accommodations, and skill in appropriately incorporating supporters. System-level factors included the availability of supporters, complexity of the healthcare system, accessibility of healthcare facilities, and stigma about autism. Further efforts are needed to empower patients, adequately train providers, increase the accessibility of the healthcare system, and decrease discrimination.",

Yet they often struggle to fit the profiles sought by employers. A growing number of companies, including SAP, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Microsoft, have reformed their HR processes in order to access neurodiverse talent—and are seeing productivity gains, quality improvement, boosts in innovative capabilities, and increased employee engagement as a result. The programs vary but have seven major elements in common. Companies should: Team with governments or nonprofits experienced in working with people with disabilities Use noninterview assessment processes Train other workers and managers in what to expect Set up a support system Tailor methods for managing careers Scale the program Mainstream the program The work for managers will be harder, but the payoff to companies will be considerable: access to more of their employees’ talents, along with diverse perspectives that will help them compete.",

The different elements of a spectrum either have a similar appearance or are thought to be caused by the same underlying mechanism. In either case, a spectrum approach is taken because there appears to be \"not a unitary disorder but rather a syndrome composed of subgroups\". The spectrum may represent a range of severity, comprising relatively \"severe\" mental disorders through to relatively \"mild and nonclinical deficits\". In some cases, a spectrum approach joins conditions that were previously considered separately. A notable example of this trend is the autism spectrum, where conditions on this spectrum may now all be referred to as autism spectrum disorders. A spectrum approach may also expand the type or the severity of issues which are included, which may lessen the gap with other diagnoses or with what is considered \"normal\". Proponents of this approach argue that it is in line with evidence of gradations in the type or severity of symptoms in the general population.",

            "abstract": "Background Patients with “underlying” autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitute a significant minority in adult out-patient psychiatry. Diagnoses of previously unrecognised ASD are increasing in adults. Characteristics of patients with autism within adult out-patient psychiatry have not been sufficiently explored, and there have not been any systematic comparisons of characteristics between patients with and those without autism within adult out-patient psychiatric populations. Aims To examine psychiatrically relevant characteristics in autistic adult psychiatric out-patients, and to compare the characteristics with non-autistic adult psychiatric out-patients. Method We assessed 90 patients who were referred to a Swedish psychiatric out-patient clinic and screened for ASD during 2019–2020. Sixty-three patients met the DSM-5 criteria for ASD or “subthreshold” ASD. The 27 who did not meet the criteria for ASD were used as a comparison group. Assessments were made with structured and well-validated instruments, including parent ratings of developmental history. Results No differences were found between the groups regarding self-reported sociodemographic variables. The ASD group showed a higher number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders than the non-ASD group (t(88) = 5.17, 95% CI 1.29–2.91, d = 1.19). Functional level was lower in the ASD group (t(88) = -2.66, 95% CI -9.46 to -1.27, d = -0.73), and was predicted by the number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Conclusions The results underscore the need for thorough assessment of psychiatric disorders in autistic patients in adult psychiatric services. ASD should be considered as a possible “underlying” condition in adult psychiatry, and there is no easy way of ruling out ASD in this population.",

            "abstract": "Research studying aging in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is growing, but longitudinal work is needed. Autistic adults have increased risk of dementia, altered hippocampal volumes and fornix integrity, and verbal memory difficulties compared with neurotypical (NT) adults. This study examined longitudinal aging in middle-age adults with ASD versus a matched NT group, and compared findings with cross-sectional age effects across a broad adult age range. Participants were 194 adults with (n = 106; 74 male) and without (n = 88; 52 male) ASD, ages 18–71. Participants (n = 45; 40–70 age range) with two visits (2–3 years apart) were included in a longitudinal analysis. Hippocampal volume, fornix fractional anisotropy (FA), and verbal memory were measured via T1-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, respectively. Longitudinal mixed models were used for hippocampal system variables and reliable change index categories were used for Auditory Verbal Learning Test analyses. Multivariate regression was used for cross-sectional analyses. Middle-age adults with ASD had greater longitudinal hippocampal volume loss and were more likely to show clinically meaningful decline in short-term memory, compared with NT. In contrast, cross-sectional associations between increasing age and worsening short-term memory were identified in NT, but not autistic adults. Reduced fornix FA and long-term memory in ASD were found across the broad cross-sectional age range. These preliminary longitudinal findings suggest accelerated hippocampal volume loss in ASD and slightly higher rates of clinically-meaningful decline in verbal short-term memory. Contradictory cross-sectional and longitudinal results underscore the importance of longitudinal aging research in autistic adults. Lay Summary Autistic adults have increased risk of dementia, differences in brain memory structures, and difficulty with memory compared with neurotypical (NT) adults. However, there are no publications that follow the same middle-age autistic adults over time to see how their brain and memory change. Our preliminary findings in a small middle-age autism sample suggest a key memory brain structure, the hippocampus, may shrink faster over 2–3 years compared with NT, and short-term memory may become more challenging for some. Across a broad adult range, autistic adults also had reduced integrity of connections to the hippocampus and greater challenges with long-term memory. In our larger sample across a broad age range, the results did not hint at this aforementioned pattern of accelerated aging. This underscores the importance of more aging research in autism, and especially research where people are followed over time.",

            "abstract": "Since its initial description, the concept of autism has been firmly rooted within the conventional medical paradigm of child psychiatry. Increasingly, there have been calls from the autistic community and, more recently, nonautistic researchers, to rethink the way in which autism science is framed and conducted. Neurodiversity, where autism is seen as one form of variation within a diversity of minds, has been proposed as a potential alternative paradigm. In this review, we concentrate on three major challenges to the conventional medical paradigm – an overfocus on deficits, an emphasis on the individual as opposed to their broader context and a narrowness of perspective – each of which necessarily constrains what we can know about autism and how we are able to know it. We then outline the ways in which fundamental elements of the neurodiversity paradigm can potentially help researchers respond to the medical model’s limitations. We conclude by considering the implications of a shift towards the neurodiversity paradigm for autism science.",

            "abstract": "Did you know that an autistic professional is up to 140% more productive than an average employee when properly matched to a job that fits their skills? Yet, discrimination against neurodivergent people continues. That’s because most of the “common” workplace practices at the workplace are established for neurotypicality. While the onus to change this really lies with the organizations, the author offers a few strategies to help neurodivergent employees take control of their own success at work. First, know that your disclosure is your decision. When you own who you are, you may end up finding some allies or even inspire others to disclose their disability or identity. That said, don’t pressure yourself. If you’re not comfortable talking about your identity or the environment doesn’t feel conducive, take your time. Define what career success looks like for you. Your career path depends on your goals and priorities. Take the time to understand what you value, why you value it, and how you see those impacting your long-term growth. For undiagnosed or undisclosed autistics, job crafting may be an effective strategy for a sustainable work-life. Job crafting refers to changing some aspects of your tasks, mindset, and relationships to align with your strengths. Explore your purpose at work. For instance, joining Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and committees focused on bringing people of specific identities or life circumstances together (e.g., culture, disability, caregiving) can help you share your ideas with like-minded and supportive colleagues. Finally, know that not all office politics are bad. While there may be toxic colleagues or situations pulling you down, you can learn to be your own ally.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Autism is a disorder with stereotyped behaviors, reduced communication skills and problems in social development. There is also high incidence of intellectual disability among the autistic individuals. However, the prevalence is increasing which may be due to changes in diagnostic procedures, practice and standards, or due to increase in incidence or may be due to diagnostic over substitution. Aim: To study prevalence of autism in patient who reported for disability. Materials & Methods: The present study is a retrospective study which was conducted over a period of 2 and half year from July 2017 to December 2019 among all the patients who reported for disability in the Government Psychiatric Diseases Hospital Jammu. After getting clearance from the institutional ethical committee the records of all these patients seen during this period were reviewed and the diagnosis of all these patients was confirmed according to ICD 10. Results: The prevalence of autism in patients who reported for disability was 64.5%. 76.1% autistic patients were males whereas 23.9% were females. 69% autistic patients were below 6 years of age followed by 26.8% who were in the age group of 7 to 12 years and only 4.2% patients were between 13 to 18 years of age. Conclusion: From present study we conclude that there is high prevalence of autism among the patients who reported for disability. Hence appropriate measures should be taken up by the concerned authorities for the early identification",

            "abstract": "Policy Points Employment is a key social determinant of health and well-being for the estimated 5.4 million autistic adults in the United States-just as it is for citizens without disabilities. Evaluation and monitoring of publicly funded employment services is paramount given the dramatic increases in adults with autism who need job supports. Vocational Rehabilitation agencies appeared to be absorbing short-term employment needs of autistic people, but Medicaid was severely lacking-and losing ground-in serving those who need longer-term employment services. Across both Vocational Rehabilitation and Medicaid, we estimated that only 1.1% of working-age autistic adults who potentially need employment services are actually receiving them-leaving an estimated 1.98 million autistic individuals without the employment services that are associated with achievement of well-being. CONTEXT: Employment is a key social determinant of health. As such, high rates of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty across the rapidly growing autistic population are concerning. A web of publicly funded services exists to support the employment, and associated health and well-being, of United States citizens with autism and other intellectual and developmental disabilities, namely through Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) and Medicaid home- and community-based services (HCBS) waivers. Given an absence of overarching surveillance of employment services, this study aimed to characterize the distribution of autistic service users across Medicaid versus VR, understand the types of employment services utilized within these programs and expenditures, and assess overall capacity to provide employment services as needs continue to increase. METHODS: This study examined the distribution of employment services among autistic people compared with those with intellectual disability using 2008-2016 data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Rehabilitation Services Administration. Estimated need for employment services among autistic individuals was compared with capacity derived from VR service counts and a review of HCBS waivers. FINDINGS: The number of autistic people served through VR tripled during the study years, whereas those served through Medicaid only increased slightly. VR spending increased by 384% over the study years, whereas Medicaid costs decreased by 29%. Across VR and Medicaid, we estimated that only 1.1% of working-age autistic adults who needed employment services received them. CONCLUSIONS: Although VR appeared to be absorbing short-term employment needs of autistic individuals, Medicaid was severely lacking-and losing ground-in serving those who needed longer-term employment services. VR far outpaced Medicaid in both the number of autistic people served and total expenditures across the study years. However, an estimated 1.98 million autistic adults did not receive employment services that could be critical to improving their health and well-being.",

            "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting an estimated 1 in 59 children. ASD is highly genetically heterogeneous and may be caused by both inheritable and de novo gene variations. In the past decade, hundreds of genes have been identified that contribute to the serious deficits in communication, social cognition, and behavior that patients often experience. However, these only account for 10-20% of ASD cases, and patients with similar pathogenic variants may be diagnosed on very different levels of the spectrum. In this review, we will describe the genetic landscape of ASD and discuss how genetic modifiers such as copy number variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and epigenetic alterations likely play a key role in modulating the phenotypic spectrum of ASD patients. We also consider how genetic modifiers can alter convergent signaling pathways and lead to impaired neural circuitry formation. Lastly, we review sex-linked modifiers and clinical implications. Further understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for both comprehending ASD and for developing novel therapies.",

            "abstract": "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including those who otherwise require less support, face severe difficulties in everyday social interactions. Research in this area has primarily focused on identifying the cognitive and neurological differences that contribute to these social impairments, but social interaction by definition involves more than one person and social difficulties may arise not just from people with ASD themselves, but also from the perceptions, judgments, and social decisions made by those around them. Here, across three studies, we find that first impressions of individuals with ASD made from thin slices of real-world social behavior by typically-developing observers are not only far less favorable across a range of trait judgments compared to controls, but also are associated with reduced intentions to pursue social interaction. These patterns are remarkably robust, occur within seconds, do not change with increased exposure, and persist across both child and adult age groups. However, these biases disappear when impressions are based on conversational content lacking audio-visual cues, suggesting that style, not substance, drives negative impressions of ASD. Collectively, these findings advocate for a broader perspective of social difficulties in ASD that considers both the individual’s impairments and the biases of potential social partners.",

            "abstract": "A practical consideration for many intellectually able adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is whether to disclose their diagnostic status or try to mask their autistic characteristics to avoid judgment and discrimination. Here, we assessed first impressions of adults with ASD and typically developing controls (N = 40) made by typically developing observers (N = 215) when their diagnostic status was either withheld, accurately provided, or inaccurately provided. First impressions were less favorable for ASD participants compared to typically developing controls across a range of judgments, but were significantly more positive when accurately labeled as ASD compared to when no label was provided, when mislabeled as typically developing, or when mislabeled as having schizophrenia. For typically developing participants, ratings did not change when accurately labeled but improved when mislabeled as ASD. Greater autistic traits for the ASD and typically developing participants were associated with less favorable first impressions, and females were rated more favorably than males. Autism knowledge of the raters, but not age, IQ, or autistic traits, was positively associated with more favorable impressions of ASD participants. Collectively, these findings suggest that first impressions for intellectually able adults with ASD improve with diagnostic disclosure and increased autism understanding on the part of peers.",

It is essential to classify ASD children with and without intellectual disability (ID) to aid etiological research, provide services, and inform evidence-based educational and health planning.Using a cross-sectional study design, data from 2000 to 2016 active ASD surveillance among 8-year-olds residing in the New York-New Jersey Metropolitan Area were analyzed to determine ASD prevalence with and without ID. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to identify trends for ASD with ID (ASD-I) and without ID (ASD-N).Overall, 4661 8-year-olds were identified with ASD. Those that were ASI-I were 1505 (32.3%) and 2764 (59.3%) were ASD-N. Males were 3794 (81.4%), 946 (20.3%) were non-Hispanic Black (Black), 1230 (26.4%) were Hispanic, and 2114 (45.4%) were non-Hispanic white (white). We observed 2-fold and 5-fold increases in the prevalence of ASD-I and ASD-N, respectively, from 2000-2016. Black children were 30% less likely to be identified with ASD-N compared with white children. Children residing in affluent areas were 80% more likely to be identified with ASD-N compared with children in underserved areas. A greater proportion of children with ASD-I resided in vulnerable areas compared with children with ASD-N. Males had higher prevalence compared with females regardless of ID status; however, male-to-female ratios were slightly lower among ASD-I compared with ASD-N cases.One-in-3 children with ASD had ID. Disparities in the identification of ASD without ID were observed among Black and Hispanic children as well as among children residing in underserved areas.",

            "abstract": "Current United States statistics suggest that autistic individuals will experience high unemployment and underemployment rates throughout their lives. Furthermore, despite the passage of federal legislation to employ young autistic adults in competitive integrated settings, where they work alongside non-disabled workers and earn at least minimum wage, most individuals receiving state services still are placed in day programs or sheltered workshops. Since meaningful employment is the most important determinant of life satisfaction, this failure is a critical societal problem, exerting increasing pressure for systems change. But the news is not all bad. Private sector companies have increased their hiring of disabled workers, producing a growing base of expertise in the recruitment, on-boarding, training, and management of autistic employees. This has led to a growing recognition that autistic individuals can be ideal workers. Autism researchers have advanced the field by investigating these private industry programs as well as conducting efficacy trials of interventions and services that help autistic individuals in the workplace. However, gaps in knowledge persist stemming from the heterogeneity of autistic workers, limited knowledge about those not receiving state services, and a system of federal services that is fragmented, poorly coordinated, difficult to navigate, and over-taxed. Autism researchers can continue to improve outcomes of autistic workers through investigations of the fit between autistic workers, their preferences, and the characteristics of available jobs, and through effectiveness trails of promising employment interventions and services that promote systems change that help break down the barriers to better integration of existing state services and resources in the United States.",

            "abstract": "Background Little is known about the impact of aging with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on cognition. As a first step in addressing this gap in our knowledge, the current study examined cognitive functioning among older adults with elevated, but subclinical levels of autistic traits (i.e., the Broad Autism Phenotype; BAP) compared to older adults without the BAP. Method Forty older adults (aged 60–91, M = 73 years) were recruited and classified as meeting criteria for the BAP (n = 20) or not (control older adults, COA; n = 20). Different components of executive function as well as episodic memory were measured using standardized performance-based neuropsychological assessments in addition to a self-report questionnaire of executive function difficulties. Results Despite no differences in age, sex ratio, educational history or IQ, the BAP group demonstrated poorer performance on measures of executive function and episodic memory compared to the COA group. The BAP group also self-reported more executive function difficulties in everyday settings. Moreover, differences in working memory and attentional shifting were maintained after accounting for the influences of IQ and both depression and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions These findings suggest that aging with the BAP confers additional risk to cognitive function for older adults. As the BAP forms a bridge in the continuum from typical to atypical levels of autistic traits, these findings suggest that individuals with ASD might also incur cognitive costs as they age into older adulthood.",

            "abstract": "The mental and physical health profile of autistic people has been studied in adolescence and adulthood, with elevated rates of most conditions being reported. However, this has been little studied taking a dimensional approach to autistic traits and in older age.A total of 20,220 adults aged 50–81 years from the PROTECT study reported whether they experienced persistent sociocommunicative traits characteristic of autism. Approximately 1%, 276 individuals, were identified as endorsing elevated autistic traits in childhood and currently, henceforth the “Autism Spectrum Trait” (AST) group. An age- and gender-matched comparison group was formed of 10,495 individuals who did not endorse any autistic behavioral traits, henceforth the “Control Older Adults” (COA) group. Differences between AST and COA groups were explored in self-reported psychiatric diagnoses, self-reported symptoms of current depression and anxiety, and self-reported physical health diagnoses. Associations were also examined between autistic traits and health across the whole sample.The AST group reported significantly elevated rates of psychiatric diagnoses compared to the COA group. Additionally, the AST group showed significantly higher self-reported symptoms of current depression and anxiety than the COA group. However, few differences were observed in individual physical health conditions, and no differences in total co-occurring physical diagnoses between groups. Similar associations between autistic traits and health were also found taking a dimensional approach across the whole sample.These findings suggest that older adults with elevated autistic traits may be at greater risk of poorer mental, but not physical, health in later life. Future studies should incorporate polygenic scores to elucidate the possible genetic links between the propensity to autism/high autistic traits and to psychiatric conditions, and to explore whether those with elevated autistic traits experience particular barriers to mental health care.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the number of autistic people entering university has increased in Australia and worldwide. While an encouraging trend, autistic students’ completion rates remain much lower than non-autistic students in Australia. Perhaps unsurprisingly, numerous studies investigating autistic people’s experiences at universities have identified stigma and discrimination as a significant barrier facing autistic people in higher education. In this study, our team of autistic co-researchers and non-autistic researchers co-produced an in-depth qualitative study to understand the contexts and circumstances in which autistic people felt stigmatised or experienced discrimination at universities in Australia. We interviewed 21 autistic people who either had completed at least one university course, or were studying a university course, or had enrolled in but discontinued at least one university course in Australia. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we identified four themes: (1) “My disability is something that people just don’t have a clue about”, (2) “the system is really stacked against you”, (3) the onus is on autistic students, and (4) “grit and stubbornness”. Based on these findings, we suggested implementing Universal Design for Learning, neurodiversity-affirming and trauma-informed practices, together with a participatory approach to better design university curricula, processes, and support services for autistic students. Lay Abstract Autistic students experience many challenges at university. One significant barrier identified in past research was autistic students’ experiences of discrimination (i.e. being treat differently) and stigma (being judged differently). Our research team included both autistic and non-autistic researchers who designed a project to help explore autistic students’ experiences of stigma and discrimination at Australian universities. We interviewed 21 autistic students who went to a university – some had completed qualifications, and some had not. From our interviews, we identified four themes: (1) “My disability is something that people just don’t have a clue about”, (2) “the system is really stacked against you”, (3) the onus is on autistic students, and (4) “grit and stubbornness”. As a result, we recommended changes in the way courses are written and taught so that autistic people have opportunities that meet their ways of learning. It is also important for university staff to understand the impact of trauma experienced by autistic people and that universities work together with autistic people to design courses and supports that include autistic ways of learning, accessible university processes and identify support needs.",

However, the effect sizes for implicated chromosomal loci are small, hard to replicate and current evidence does not explain the majority of the estimated heritability. Phenotypic heterogeneity could be one phenomenon complicating identification of genetic factors. We used data from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, head circumferences, and ages at exams as classifying variables to identify more clinically similar subgroups of individuals with ASD. We identified two distinct subgroups of cases within the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange dataset, primarily defined by the overall severity of evaluated traits. In addition, there was significant familial clustering within subgroups (odds ratio, OR \\approx 1.38–1.42, P < 0.00001), and genotypes were more similar within subgroups compared to the unsubgrouped dataset (Fst = 0.17  0.0.0009). These results suggest that the subgroups recapitulate genetic etiology. Using the same approach in an independent dataset from the Autism Genome Project, we similarly identified two distinct subgroups of cases and confirmed this severity-based dichotomy. We also observed evidence for genetic contributions to subgroups identified in the replication dataset. Our results provide more effective methods of phenotype definition that should increase power to detect genetic factors influencing risk for ASD.",

Behavioral problems that are commonly observed in autism may be related to the core features of ASD or comorbid diagnoses. Aims: To assess the prevalence of ASD in those with ID referred for disability assessment and the associated medical and psychological comorbid issues. Materials and methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study that included 133 children with mild or moderate ID between 6 and 18 years of age. The study tools used were Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and a questionnaire to assess medical symptoms. Results: The prevalence of comorbid ASD in children with ID was 16.39%. Individuals with ASD had higher behavioral problems (p = 0.001) and medical issues that included gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (constipation, p = 0.001; bloating, p = 0.03; and abdominal pain, p = 0.03) and seizure (p = 0.002). Children with severe ASD scores had higher behavioral problem scores. Conclusion: Individuals with ID who were referred for disability assessment had a significant prevalence of ASD. These children had higher behavioral problems and medical issues. It is thus important to screen for ASD in individuals with ID for better management of these individuals.",

            "abstract": "Seven decades have elapsed since Leo Kanner described the syndrome he termed early infantile autism. Over this time, and particularly over the past two decades, noteworthy changes have occurred in how the condition is conceptualized. Here we provide an overview of these changes, beginning with a brief discussion of the significance of classification in general before discussing Kanner&apos;s original paper and subsequent changes. We touch on relevant issues, such as comorbidity, dimensional aspects of diagnosis and screening, and the complex issue of diagnosis relative to eligibility for services. Approaches to diagnosis have tended to swing from emphasizing overarching groups (lumping) to focusing on potentially distinct subgroups (splitting). Autism raises particular problems given the broad range of syndrome expression over age and developmental level. The most recent revision of the American Psychiatric Association&apos;s diagnostic taxonomy marks a significant departure from its predecessor and has been the focus of much debate. It remains unclear which of the currently existing categorical approaches will ultimately be most widely applied. We hope to convey a sense of areas in which consensus has been achieved and areas of continued controversy.",

A total of 41 autistic adults, 50 parents of autistic children and 31 clinical professionals living in New Zealand and Australia completed open-ended survey questions regarding their perceptions of support goals for young autistic children. Reflexive thematic analysis resulted in five overarching themes related to early support goals: (a) neurodiversity affirming, (b) change the environment, not the child, (c) helping adults to support autistic children, (d) quality of life and (e) respect boundaries. The perspectives of autistic adults, parents and professionals were mostly aligned.",

            "abstract": "The prevalence of anxiety is higher in autistic young people, compared to neurotypical youths. However, the nature of worry in autistic young people is under-researched. Transition from secondary school is a time of change and can be challenging for autistic adolescents. This project explored the content and emotional impact of worries in neurotypical and autistic young people during transition. Twenty-two autistic people and 22 neurotypical people, aged 16–18, were recruited from mainstream schools. Participants completed a novel task to identify and explore the nature of their main worries. The participants’ worry frequency and distress levels in relation to their most salient concerns, and their anxiety levels, were measured. Content analysis highlighted similarities and differences between the two groups’ worries. Both groups worried about failure and their prospects of further education. Autistic people were more concerned about change and friendship, whereas more salient worries for neurotypical individuals were about work and money. Autistic people were more distressed by their worries than neurotypical individuals. Findings regarding the nature of autistic young people’s worries may help inform interventions. Moreover, asking autistic people about their worries as they leave school may help to address their concerns, ease their transition and reduce distress.",

            "abstract": "Prevalence estimates of autism are essential for informing public policy, raising awareness, and developing research priorities. Using a systematic review, we synthesized estimates of the prevalence of autism worldwide. We examined factors accounting for variability in estimates and critically reviewed evidence relevant for hypotheses about biological or social determinants (viz., biological sex, sociodemographic status, ethnicity/race, and nativity) potentially modifying prevalence estimates of autism. We performed the search in November 2021 within Medline for studies estimating autism prevalence, published since our last systematic review in 2012. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Since 2012, 99 estimates from 71 studies were published indicating a global autism prevalence that ranges within and across regions, with a median prevalence of 100/10,000 (range: 1.09/10,000 to 436.0/10,000). The median male-to-female ratio was 4.2. The median percentage of autism cases with co-occurring intellectual disability was 33.0%. Estimates varied, likely reflecting complex and dynamic interactions between patterns of community awareness, service capacity, help seeking, and sociodemographic factors. A limitation of this review is that synthesizing methodological features precludes a quality appraisal of studies. Our findings reveal an increase in measured autism prevalence globally, reflecting the combined effects of multiple factors including the increase in community awareness and public health response globally, progress in case identification and definition, and an increase in community capacity. Hypotheses linking factors that increase the likelihood of developing autism with variations in prevalence will require research with large, representative samples and comparable autism diagnostic criteria and case-finding methods in diverse world regions over time. Lay Summary We reviewed studies of the prevalence of autism worldwide, considering the impact of geographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors on prevalence estimates. Approximately 1/100 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder around the world. Prevalence estimates increased over time and varied greatly within and across sociodemographic groups. These findings reflect changes in the definition of autism and differences in the methodology and contexts of prevalence studies.",
