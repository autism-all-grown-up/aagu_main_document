## The New World of Autism

Recent advancements in the understanding of autism, largely driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers, have highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in understanding, coexisting with, and when necessary, supporting autistic individuals.

Key findings include [@ASAN2009; @Weiss2023]:

-   **Autism is a Lifelong Condition:** Autism is neurodevelopmental and largely genetic in origin. Although the strength and number of autistic traits they display may vary over time, an autistic person is born with differences that will last their entire life.

-   **The Autism Spectrum is not Linear:** Autistic people aren't "more" or "less" autistic so much as they are autistic in different ways.

-   **Misconceptions Abound:** New research has reshaped our understanding of autism and refuted many harmful misconceptions. Some autistic people do have accompanying conditions that can result in problems with body awareness, identifying their emotional state, or using speech. However, autistic people do not intrinsically lack feelings, empathy, social skills, or the ability to communicate [@Crompton2020a; @Chan2023]. Many autistic people who are unable to speak (for one or more reasons) do have language skills and can be competent writers and speakers with assistive technology [@Jaswal2024; @Safira2020; @Courchesne2015].

-   **Autism is a Full-Body Experience:** Autism frequently comes with physiological differences that are just beginning to be studied and understood [@Khachadourian2023; @Bougeard2021; @Micai2023]. Autistic people may experience higher or lower risk for certain diseases and conditions as well as different levels of physical traits such as hypermobility. Many autistic people experience pain, sound, touch, taste and other physical sensations either heightened or diminished [@Sibeoni2022; @Taels2023]. Few doctors are aware of these issues, and most are poorly trained in most aspects of supporting autistic patients. [@Clarke2022; @Corden2022; @Doherty2021]

-   **Disability can be Contextual:** Most autistic individuals are not intellectually or physically disabled but face substantial challenges navigating a neurotypical world. It can feel like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best. According to research, most autistic people do not desire to be "cured", "fixed". Instead, autistic people seek a life where they can exercise self-determination, and engage in meaningful social activities, self-actualization, and employment within an inclusive society that respects their neurodivergence and values their authentic selves @Thompson-Hodgetts2023.

    > The medical establishment once considered autism and intellectual disability to be virtually inseparable. In the 1980s, as much as 69 percent of people with an autism diagnosis also had a diagnosis of \[intellectual disability\]. By 2014, the figure for a dual diagnosis...had declined to 30 percent, as researchers had sharpened the diagnostic criteria for autism." @Sohn2020

-   **Double Empathy:** The double empathy problem in autism is a theory that goes against the common belief that autistic people don't have empathy. Instead, it says that communication problems are caused by autistic and non-autistic people not understanding each other. This isn't because autistic people can't talk to each other; it's because they use two different communication styles that are hard for each other to understand [@Milton2023; @Zamzow2021].

-   **Stigma, Ableism, and Discrimination are the Biggest Challenges:** Many autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn't being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism [@Sasson2017; @Tobin2014; @Mantzalas2022; @Black2020; @Cage2019; @Bachmann2019; @Praslova2021]. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in society [@Han2021], especially in the workplace [@Raymaker2020; @Roux2023].

-   **Neurodiversity & Neurodivergence:** The *neurodiversity paradigm* recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Individuals with significantly atypical neurotypes are termed *neurodivergent*, and sometimes need different things than *neurotypical* people do. These terms are not scientific and can sometimes lead to confusion: see @sec-neurodiversity.

## Lost Generations of Autistic Adults {#sec-autism2024_lost_gen}

We have good reason to believe that autism has been part of humanity for a very long time and that the rate of occurrence has not drastically changed [@Evans2013; @Mintz2017]. There are four times as many adults as there are children in the US, so we should expect there to be a very large number of autistic adults. But past research and services have predominantly focused on children and neglected the needs of adults, especially those of us without profound disabilities. Society has failed, and continues to fail, to adequately study autistic life after high school when children lose many supports [@Laxman2019; @Roux2015].

## Missed Opportunities

Despite the challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table. Autistic people possess a variety of strengths and abilities that can be highly valuable in both personal and professional settings. Research highlights that autistic individuals often exhibit exceptional cognitive abilities, such as superior creativity, focus, and memory, which can lead to increased efficiency and unique perspectives in the workplace [@Warren2021; @Cope2022; @Halder2024; @Devenish2022]. These cognitive strengths are complemented by personal qualities like honesty, dedication, and a strong sense of integrity, making them reliable and trustworthy members of society. In contrast to the prevalent focus of helping autistic people "overcome disabilities" or "learn social skills", strengths-based interventions have been shown to improve mental health outcomes, increase knowledge in areas of interest, and promote positive social engagement and self-advocacy among autistic individuals [@Reis2024; @Lee2024; @Taylor2023; @Murthi2023].

## Unmet Needs

Autistic adults who are impacted more profoundly or who have accompanying intellectual or cognitive challenges are generally able to find support through systems of support designed for people with disabilities. Autistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While we rarely qualify for existing systems of support, many of us face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved [@Kaplan-Kahn2023; @Turnock2022; @Botha2022a]. Therefore, autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often lack access to appropriate healthcare and support services, if they even exist [@Kuo2022; @Burke2023; @Schott2021; @Kakooza-Mwesige2022; @Frankish2022; @Bearss2022]

## Misaligned Research Priorities

Past and current funding from the US Government and private sources has prioritized searching for the origins and mechanisms of autism in the hope that we can prevent autistic people form being born, prevent people from developing autistic, and "cure" or "treat" autistic people to make them less autistic. These include [@R.Insel2011; @Cervantes2021; @Singh2009; :

- **Biological and Genetic Studies**
- **Early Detection and Diagnosis**
- **Behavioral Interventions**
- **Pharmacological Treatments**

However, studies repeatedly find that a large majority of the autistic community holds a different set of priorities [@Silverman2019; @Pellicano2014; @Fletcher-Watson2019; @Crane2019; @Davies2024; @Chown2023; @Roche2021; @Frazier2018; @Cage2024; @IACC2018; @IACC2023]:

1. **Quality of Life**: Research aimed at improving the overall quality of life for autistic individuals.
2. **Services and Supports**: Studies focused on the availability, accessibility, and effectiveness of services and supports, including educational, employment, and social services.
3. **Mental Health**: Research on co-occurring mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and sensory sensitivities.
4. **Understanding and Acceptance**: Promoting understanding, acceptance, and social inclusion of autistic people in society.
5. **Autistic Adults**: Research on the needs and experiences of autistic adults, who have historically been underrepresented in autism research.

Despite decades of encouragement from autism advocates and autism researchers that funding bodies and policymakers should consider the priorities of the autistic community when allocating resources for research [@Kuo2022a; @Kuo2022b; @Pukki2022; @Cervantes2021; @Hotez2023; @Poulsen2022; @Kapp2020], this has not happened. Our current research funding continues to vastly overemphasizes basic science questions and neglect real-world changes, health and well-being, socialization, community awareness, co-occurring conditions, lifespan issues, and participatory methods to align with the autistic community's needs.
