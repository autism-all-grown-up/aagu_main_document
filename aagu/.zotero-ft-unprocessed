As far as I was concerned, autistic people are typically men, can’t connect with other people, and are obsessed with trains and cars, right? Not so. I have since learned that I am autistic despite not having these traits, which represent a stereotype of autistic people more than an accurate characterization. \n \nMany people form a concept of autism—a neurotype (type of brain) that processes social and sensory information differently from the majority of people—based on movies like Rain Man (whose protagonist is inspired by someone who was not even autistic ) rather than real-life interactions with people with autism. Stereotypes about autism can prevent those who don’t fit them from realizing they’re autistic, which means that they may not receive the support they need, or may have other, more stigmatizing labels put on them. Stereotypes can also cause autistic people to feel like something is wrong with them. Not to mention, they perpetuate pathologizing beliefs about autism, e.g. that it is caused by vaccines. \nExperts In This Article \n \n    Ari Wolf \n    Eleanor Bennett \n    Kjirsten Broughton \n    LaQuista Erinna, DBH, LCSW \n    Russell Lehmann \n    Ryan Sultan, MD , assistant professor of clinical psychiatry and director of the Mental Health Informatics Lab at Columbia University \n \nSome stereotypes about autistic people have a grain of truth to them but are misunderstood, some are true for a portion of autistic people but not others, and some are outright wrong. Here are a few common autism myths and misconceptions that are worth questioning. \n1. Myth: Autistic people don’t care about other people. \n \nFact: When many people think of autism, they picture someone who lacks empathy. This can make the label of “autistic” very stigmatizing, as it implies that autistic people are unkind or uncaring. In reality, the diagnostic criteria for autism say nothing about empathy. \nRelated Stories \nI Don’t ‘Have Autism’ —I’m Autistic.

For instance, I don’t usually have strong feelings in response to world events, as my practical brain prefers to focus on things in my immediate environment—but this doesn’t mean I don’t empathize with people close to me. \n \nOther autistic people may not always empathize with those around them, but this is often due to a lack of understanding rather than a lack of caring. “I have a great deal of empathy once I understand the context of a situation,” says Eleanor Bennett, an autistic 27-year-old in Cambridge, UK and founder of Competitive Insight . We want to be there for people and help them; we just may need the chance to learn how to do so. \n \n“Autistic individuals are fully capable of empathy and can even experience hyper-empathy, where they feel overwhelming pain, both emotionally and physically, at just the thought of someone else's suffering,” says Kjirsten Broughton , a neurodivergent speech and language pathologist specializing in autism. “Many autistic individuals often exhibit hyper-empathy toward animals.” Ari Wolf, a 34-year-old autistic graduate student in Eugene, Oregon, identifies as hyper-empathetic, explaining, “we simply express this empathy differently from most people.” For example, Wolf says that an autistic person might respond to someone’s story about their pain by telling a story about a time they’ve felt similarly. “We view this as an experience of empathy, but it is rarely received that way.” \n2. Myth: Relationships aren’t important to autistic people \n \nAutistic people are often seen as loners or anti-social, but we need human connection just like everyone else. Many of us are simply wary of others due to the mistreatment we’ve received in the past. \n \n“The reason, personally, that it might seem like I don't want a close relationship is because, to be blunt, people scare me,” says autistic motivational speaker Russell Lehmann . “I have been hurt a lot by this world, due to the naïveté, purity, innocence, and fragility of being on the spectrum. Something as simple as a smile not being returned can leave a paper cut on my heart.” \n \nSome of us enjoy spending time alone because social activities are overwhelming to us or because we are engrossed in our special interests—topics and activities autistic people are extremely passionate about. But this doesn’t mean we don’t want any friends, close family relationships, or romantic relationships. In fact, research shows that autistic people experience loneliness more often than neurotypical people, probably because others so often exclude us. While some autistic people may need lots of time to ourselves, we still appreciate feeling wanted and included. \n3. Myth: Autistic people lack social skills \n \nGiven that one diagnostic criterion for autism is “persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction,” it’s understandable that people often assume autism entails a lack of social skills. However, the criterion itself is problematic: Who decides what counts as a deficit? Usually, it is neurotypical people. What a neurotypical person might call a deficit, autistic people may simply call a difference. \n \n“It is extremely common for any dominant social group to demean and dismiss the marginalized social group's preferred form of communication,” Wolf points out. “Misogynistic men often mock or belittle women's voices as too sharp, too domineering, too shrewish, too whatever.” Similarly, the denigration of autistic people’s social behavior as inept or awkward may be more political than scientific. \n \n“While some autistic individuals may face challenges in social interactions and communication with neurotypical individuals, it is important to note that these challenges are not one-sided,” Broughton explains. “Neurotypical individuals also encounter difficulties when communicating with autistic people.” In other words, it’s not that autistic people can’t communicate—it’s that autistic people have trouble communicating withneurotypical people, and vice versa. \n \nThis isn’t always the case either, though. Many autistic people, especially autistic women , learn to “mask”—that is, mimic the speech, body language, and social behavior of neurotypical people. This may not come naturally to us, but we do it in order to fit in, which can cause us to exhibit the same social skills as neurotypical people. Masking can be emotionally taxing for autistic people and is part of the reason why many of us shy away from social situations. \n4. Myth: Autism is a male characteristic \n \nAutism is often stereotyped as a male condition, leading many women and non-binary people to go undiagnosed. (I was not diagnosed until my thirties). However, while it’s true that men dominate autism diagnoses, recent research has shown that autism is more common in women than previously believed—and we may still not even know how common it is . Part of the reason for this is that men’s autistic traits can sometimes be more visible. Autism often shows up differently in women , as women are more likely to learn conventional social behavior by observing others and engage in masking. \n \nBecause of autistic women’s tendency to mask and because of clinicians’ bias toward diagnosing men, autism in women is likely vastly underestimated , which means many women go years (or their whole lives) without help navigating the world as an autistic person. Women are also frequently misdiagnosed , sometimes with stigmatized conditions like borderline personality disorder. In addition, trans and non-binary people are more likely than cis people to be autistic , yet this population is often left out of discussions about autism. \n \nAlong the same lines, autistic people do not universally have stereotypically “masculine” interests such as math and science. While many autistic people do have particular interests (which, again, are not unique to men), these interests can include anything from fashion to theater to movies. \n5. Myth: Autistic people are violent \n \nUnfortunately, after a violent crime is in the news, you sometimes hear rumors that the perpetrator was autistic. (Think back, for instance, to internet speculation that the mass shooter Elliot Rodger was autistic .) “This stereotype is not only inaccurate, but it is also harmful,” says Ryan Sultan, MD , a psychiatrist and researcher at Columbia University. The view of autistic people as aggressive can lead to many problems including bullying, exclusion, employment discrimination, and even violence toward autistic people, he explains. \n \n“Autistic people are no more likely to be violent or aggressive than anyone else,” says Dr. Sultan. Indeed, a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychiatry found that autistic people were no more likely than neurotypical people to commit crimes. Autistic people are, however, more likely to be the victims of crimes , including sexual assault and physical violence. \n6. Myth: There is such a thing as “looking autistic” \n \nSome autistic people get told they “don’t look autistic,” which not only invalidates their identity but also reflects a misunderstanding of autism. “Autism does not have a look,” says LaQuista Erinna, DBH, LCSW, a psychotherapist and mother of an autistic son. “Every autistic individual is different and will present themself in their own unique way.” \n \nAnd contrary to media stereotypes, there is no one way to act autistic. Autistic people have a wide range of personalities, interests, and characteristics. “Each person with autism is unique and may experience different challenges and strengths,” says Dr. Sultan. That’s why it’s called the autism spectrum; it includes a wide range of people and experiences. \n7. Myth: Being autistic is a bad thing \n \nI have personally had people tell me “you don’t seem autistic” as if it is a compliment, but I don’t see it that way. I personally take it as a compliment when someone sees that I am autistic! It means they see that I’m unique, passionate, delightfully quirky, and fiercely individualistic—and, more simply, that they see me as I am. And who I am is a beautiful thing to celebrate, not a deficit to put down. \nThe Wellness Intel You Need—Without the BS You Don't \nSign up today to have the latest (and greatest) well-being news and expert-approved tips delivered straight to your inbox. \nSubscribe \n \nTags: Healthy Mind , Mental Challenges \nHealth Healthy Body \nPaid Content GoodRx \nHow To Choose the Best Birth Control Option for You Based on Your Lifestyle, According to an MD \nWell+Good Editors \nMay 22, 2024 \nThumbnail for How To Choose the Best Birth Control Option for You Based on Your Lifestyle, According to an MD \nPin It \nPhoto: Stocksy/Ángela Rober \nShare on facebook Share on twitter Share on pinterest Share on email \nT he pill. IUDs. Vaginal rings. Contraceptive injections. Arm implants. Diaphragms. Condoms. With so many options to choose from, picking out the right birth control method for you can be... a lot. \n \nBetween 2017 and 2019, approximately 65 percent of women aged 15 to 49 in the United States used contraception—and yet they still face numerous challenges, from potential side effects to managing the costs, particularly for people whose insurance coverage doesn't include contraception. \n \nBut, you do have some help: By using GoodRx's free prescription savings platform, you can save an average of $43 on birth control pills. You can also find cost-effective solutions for many different methods of birth control, thanks to GoodRx's manufacturer partnerships. \n \nBut how do you know which of those options is right for you? Sophie Vergnaud, MD , senior medical director at GoodRx, is sharing three questions you can ask yourself to help narrow down your options. And, for those looking for more information about birth control generally, a helpful resource is GoodRx's Women's Health Hub , where you can find extensive educational resources about birth control options and available savings. \n1. Are you okay with making birth control part of your daily routine? \n \nWe all have that friend whose alarm goes off during every social gathering, reminding her to take her birth control. If you're cool with joining her ranks, then the pill—the most common form of birth control—may be a good option for you. It's been around for decades and has two main types: Combination pills that contain estrogen and progestin and mini pills that contain only progestin (like the first FDA-approved over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill ). The pill is 99 percent effective—but only if you take it at the same time every day and don't miss a dose, Dr. Vergnaud says. (Hence the alarm.) \n \nBy checking GoodRx, you could save an average of $43 on birth control medications, and find savings on common birth control pills such as Loestrin or Yaz . However, there are still other affordable options available to you if the daily reminder isn't your thing. \"If your lifestyle makes this challenging or you don’t want to have to think about contraception every day, consider an IUD or injection,\" Dr. Vergnaud says. \n \nA ring is another good set-it-and-forget it option. Try the monthly NuvaRing for as low as $48 a month via GoodRx, or the annual Annovera ring, which works out to $1 per day. No phone alarms necessary. \n2. Are you worried about side effects? \n \nYou've most likely heard stories from friends (or experienced some yourself) about the potential uncomfortable side effects of birth control—ahem, headaches, nausea, mood changes, and breast tenderness. If you're sensitive to these types of side effects, you may want to consider a non-hormonal or low-dose birth control option, such as Lo Loestrin Fe , which contains only 10 micrograms of daily estrogen. \"From vaginal rings, to patches, IUDs, implants, and injections—you have many options,\" Dr. Vergnaud says. \"You’ll find something that works well for you.\" \n \nTalk to your health-care professional—whether that be a doctor or a pharmacist (yes, in 34 states and Washington D.C., pharmacists are allowed to prescribe birth control)—about your options. \n3. Are you looking for contraception that doubles as treatment? \n \nBirth control can do more than prevent pregnancy. \"Some forms of contraception double up as treatment for a whole range of conditions— including hormonal acne , mood disorders, fibroids, and endometriosis,\" Dr. Vergnaud says. \"Depending on what other health concerns you’re trying to address, it may make sense to switch your contraception to maximize the benefits.\" \n \nThe most common example of this is the pill, which can be prescribed to treat pain from periods, PCOS, and endometriosis, as well as to help clear up acne. \n \nBottom line: You don't have to navigate the complicated world of contraception alone. Although figuring it out may not be an exact science, tapping GoodRx for info and savings—and working with your health-care professional—can help put you in control of your health care. \nTags: Healthy Body , Menstrual Health \n \nLoading More Posts... \nFeatured Collection \nhappy place \nThe Beach Is My Happy Place—and Here Are 3 Science-Backed Reasons It Should Be Yours, Too Paid Content Evolve \n \nThe Beach Is My Happy Place—and Here Are 3 Science-Backed Reasons It Should Be Yours, Too \n \nYour official excuse to add \"OOD\" (ahem, out of doors) to your cal. \nhow to use serum for face \n4 Mistakes That Are Causing You to Waste Money on Skin-Care Serums, According to an Esthetician Skin-Care Tips \n \n4 Mistakes That Are Causing You to Waste Money on Skin-Care Serums, According to an Esthetician \nbest denim shorts for chafing \nThese Are the Best Anti-Chafing Denim Shorts—According to Some Very Happy Reviewers Active Clothing \n \nThese Are the Best Anti-Chafing Denim Shorts—According to Some Very Happy Reviewers \n \nWellness In Your Inbox \nWell+Good helps you to pave your own personalized path to living well.
