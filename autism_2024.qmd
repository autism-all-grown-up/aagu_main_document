## The New World of Autism

Recent advancements in the understanding of autism, largely driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers, have highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in understanding, coexisting with, and when necessary, supporting autistic individuals. {{something about shift from behavioral description to internal}}

Key findings include [@ASAN2009; @Weiss2023]: {{move these citations to where they belong}}

-   **Lifelong Condition:**

-   **The Autism Spectrum is not Linear:** Autistic people aren't "more" or "less" autistic so much as they are autistic in different ways.

-   **Misconceptions:** New research has reshaped our understanding of autism and refuted many harmful misconceptions. Some autistic people do have accompanying conditions that can result in problems with body awareness, identifying their emotional state, or using speech. However, autistic people do not intrinsically lack feelings, empathy, social skills, or the ability to communicate {{citations: autistic people sociability}}.

    Also, by the most current estimates, less than 1/3 of autistic people have intellectual or cognitive difficulties{{citations: rates of ID}}. Many autistic people who are unable to speak (for one or more reasons) do have language skills and can be competent writers and speakers with assistive technology {{citations: language}}.

-   **Disability can be Contextual:** Most autistic individuals are not intellectually or physically disabled but face substantial challenges navigating a neurotypical world. It can feel like being a left-handed person using right-handed scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best. {{something about not wanting to be cured just have life easier}} {{citations}}

-   **Not Just in the Brain:** Autism frequently comes with physiological differences that are just beginning to be understood and studied{{citations: co-occurring physical}}. Autistic people may experience higher or lower risk for certain diseases and conditions as well as different levels of physical abilities like flexibility. Many autistic people experience pain and other sensations differently. {{citations: pain other physical differences}} Few doctors are aware of these issues, and most are poorly trained in most aspects of supporting autistic patients. {{citations: doctors and training}}

-   **Double Empathy:**

    {{Describe double empathy with citations}}

-   **The True Challenges:** Many autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn't being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism [@Sasson2017; @Tobin2014; @Mantzalas2022; @Black2020; @Cage2019; @Bachmann2019; @Praslova2021]. Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is a significant barrier in society [@Han2021], especially in the workplace [@Raymaker2020; @Roux2023].

-   **Neurodiversity & Neurodivergence:** The *neurodiversity paradigm* recognizes autism as a natural variation in human neurology. Individuals with significantly atypical neurotypes are *neurodivergent*, and sometimes need different things than *neurotypical* people do. These terms are not scientific and can sometimes lead to confusion: see @sec-neurodiversity.

## Lost Generations of Autistic Adults {#sec-autism2024_lost_gen}

There are four times as many adults as children, so, since autism is not new to the human race {{citation}}, there are four times as many autistic adults as there are autistic children. But Research and services have predominantly focused on children and neglected the needs of adults, especially those of us without profound disabilities. Society has failed, and continues to fail, to adequately study autistic life after high school when children lose many supports {{citations: services cliff}}.

Despite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills, talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for them at the table {{citations: ND advantage}}

## Unmet Needs

Autistic adults who are impacted more profoundly or who have accompanying intellectual or cognitive challenges are generally able to find support through systems of support designed for people with disabilities. Autistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a conundrum. While we rarely qualify for existing systems of support, many of us face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved {{citations: access to services}}. Therefore, autistic adults without intellectual disabilities often lack access to appropriate healthcare and support services, if they even exist {{citations: lack of access to services}}
