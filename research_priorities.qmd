# Alignment of Autism Research Priorities with the Needs and Wants of Autistic People

The alignment of autism research priorities with the needs and wants of autistic individuals has been a topic of growing interest and scrutiny. Studies indicate that there can be a significant gap between the research priorities of the scientific community and those of the autistic community.

# Research Priorities of the Scientific Community

Traditionally, autism research has focused heavily on: 
1. **Biological and Genetic Studies**: Understanding the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of autism【Lai et al., 2020】. 
2. **Early Detection and Diagnosis**: Developing methods for early identification of autism in children【Zwaigenbaum et al., 2015】. 
3. **Behavioral Interventions**: Creating and refining therapies aimed at modifying behaviors associated with autism【Sandbank et al., 2020】. 
4. **Pharmacological Treatments**: Investigating medications that could alleviate some symptoms associated with autism【Arnold et al., 2020】.

# Research Priorities of the Autistic Community

In contrast, autistic individuals and their families often prioritize: 1. **Quality of Life**: Research aimed at improving the overall quality of life for autistic individuals【Pellicano et al., 2014】. 2. **Services and Supports**: Studies focused on the availability, accessibility, and effectiveness of services and supports, including educational, employment, and social services【Fletcher-Watson et al., 2019】. 3. **Mental Health**: Research on co-occurring mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and sensory sensitivities【Crane et al., 2019】. 4. **Understanding and Acceptance**: Promoting understanding, acceptance, and social inclusion of autistic people in society【Kapp, 2020】. 5. **Autistic Adults**: Research on the needs and experiences of autistic adults, who have historically been underrepresented in autism research【Nicolaidis et al., 2020】.

# Recent Efforts to Bridge the Gap

Recent efforts to align research priorities with the needs of the autistic community have included: 1. **Participatory Research Models**: Engaging autistic individuals in the research process, from planning to execution and dissemination of findings【Fletcher-Watson et al., 2019】. 2. **Surveys and Consultations**: Conducting surveys and consultations with autistic individuals and their families to identify their priorities【Pellicano et al., 2014】. 3. **Policy and Funding Shifts**: Encouraging funding bodies and policymakers to consider the priorities of the autistic community when allocating resources for research【Kapp, 2020】.

# Studies and Surveys

Several studies and surveys highlight the discrepancy and efforts to address it: 1. A study published in the journal *Autism* found that autistic adults and their families prioritize research on health services, educational and vocational supports, and the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving daily living skills over genetic and biological research【Pellicano et al., 2014】. 2. The James Lind Alliance (UK) conducted a priority-setting partnership with autistic adults, their families, and clinicians, resulting in a top ten list of research priorities, emphasizing areas such as mental health, support services, and social care【James Lind Alliance, 2021】. 3. A survey by the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) in the U.S. reflected similar priorities, with a strong emphasis on research that improves quality of life and supports independent living【IACC, 2018】.

# Conclusion

While there has been progress in aligning autism research priorities with the needs and wants of the autistic community, significant gaps remain. Continued efforts to engage autistic individuals in research processes and prioritize their needs in research agendas are crucial for creating a more inclusive and relevant body of research.

Autism research has historically been misaligned with the priorities and needs of autistic individuals, although recent efforts are attempting to bridge this gap. Studies indicate a significant mismatch between the focus of autism research and the areas that autistic people deem important. For instance, while much research has traditionally centered on genetics, treatments, and causes, autistic individuals prioritize mental health, support services, and understanding societal attitudes towards them [3]. Employment is another critical area where autistic people seek more research, particularly on gaining and sustaining meaningful employment and addressing all stages of the employment lifecycle, from job access to retirement [4] [6]. Despite these clear priorities, many studies still focus on normalizing autistic traits rather than addressing the practical needs and lived experiences of autistic adults [8]. Moreover, the involvement of autistic individuals in research remains limited, often relegated to tokenistic roles rather than as co-researchers, which undermines the potential for research to be truly reflective of their needs [5]. The dissatisfaction with the Lancet Commission's recommendations further underscores the disconnect between research agendas and the autistic community's expectations [2]. Autistic self-advocates and their families emphasize the need for research on effective services and interventions that genuinely improve quality of life, yet current methodologies often fail to capture the nuances of service effectiveness [7]. Additionally, healthcare research tends to focus more on patient-centered interventions rather than systemic changes needed to improve healthcare access and experiences for autistic individuals [10]. The assumption that autistic individuals lack theory of mind has also been debunked by autistic researchers, yet this outdated notion persists in some literature, highlighting the need for more inclusive and accurate research perspectives [9]. Participatory research approaches, which involve autistic individuals in setting research agendas and conducting studies, have shown promise in aligning research with the community's needs and ensuring that outcomes are more relevant and impactful [1] [5]. However, these approaches are not yet the norm, and much autism research continues to exclude autistic voices except as subjects of study [5]. To truly meet the needs of autistic people, research must evolve to be more inclusive, focusing on the priorities identified by the autistic community and involving them as active participants in the research process. This shift is essential for developing meaningful interventions and supports that enhance the quality of life for autistic individuals across various domains, including mental health, employment, and healthcare [1] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10].





While there has been progress in aligning autism research priorities with the needs and wants of the autistic community, significant gaps remain. Continued efforts to engage autistic individuals in research processes and prioritize their needs in research agendas are crucial for creating a more inclusive and relevant body of research.

These studies suggest that autism research priorities should focus on real-world changes, health and well-being, socialization, community awareness, co-occurring conditions, lifespan issues, and participatory methods to align with the autistic community's needs.


The alignment of autism research priorities with the needs and preferences of the autistic community has become a critical focus in recent years. This shift aims to ensure that research efforts lead to meaningful, real-world improvements in the lives of autistic individuals and their families. This synthesis examines whether current autism research priorities are aligned with the autistic community's needs, based on insights from multiple research papers.

Although autism advocates, including many autistic autism researchers, have long advocated for centering research priorities (and therefore funding) on issues that affect autistic people over their lifespan, our current research funding still vastly overemphasizes basic science questions over issues that affect the priorities and needs of autistic individuals. To truly meet the needs of autistic people, research must evolve to be more inclusive, focusing on the priorities identified by the autistic community and involving them as active participants in the research process. This shift is essential for developing meaningful interventions and supports that enhance the quality of life for autistic individuals across various domains, including mental health, employment, and healthcare [1] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10].



Past and current funding from the US Government and private sources has prioritized searching for the origins and mechanisms of autism in the hope that we can prevent autistic people form being born, stop people from becoming autistic, and "cure" or "treat" autistic people to make them less autistic. These include:

- **Biological and Genetic Studies**
- **Early Detection and Diagnosis**
- **Behavioral Interventions**
- **Pharmacological Treatments**

However, studies repeatedly find that a large majority of the autistic community holds a different set of priorities [@Silverman2019; @Pellicano2014; @Fletcher-Watson2018; @Crane2019; @Kapp2020; @Davies2024; @Chown2023; @Roche2021; @Frazier2018; @Cage2024]:

1. **Quality of Life**: Research aimed at improving the overall quality of life for autistic individuals.
2. **Services and Supports**: Studies focused on the availability, accessibility, and effectiveness of services and supports, including educational, employment, and social services.
3. **Mental Health**: Research on co-occurring mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and sensory sensitivities.
4. **Understanding and Acceptance**: Promoting understanding, acceptance, and social inclusion of autistic people in society.
5. **Autistic Adults**: Research on the needs and experiences of autistic adults, who have historically been underrepresented in autism research.

Despite decades of encouragement from autism advocates and autism researchers [@Kuo2022a; @Kuo2022b; @Pukki2022; @Cervantes2021; @Hotez2023; @Poulsen2022], that funding bodies and policymakers should consider the priorities of the autistic community when allocating resources for research [Kapp, 2020], this has not happened. Our current research funding continues to vastly overemphasizes basic science questions and neglect real-world changes, health and well-being, socialization, community awareness, co-occurring conditions, lifespan issues, and participatory methods to align with the autistic community's needs.
